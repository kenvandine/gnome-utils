    <title>Introduction</title> 

    <para>
       <application>GNOME Search Tool</application> is a utility for
       searching files on your system. It can perform many types of
       search: by filename, by modification date, by file contents,
       etc. It is included in the
       <filename>gnome-utils</filename> package, which is a part of
       the GNOME desktop environment. This document describes version
       1.0.50 of <application>GNOME Search Tool</application>.
    </para>

    <para> The search tool can be started by selecting
      <guimenuitem>GNOME Search Tool</guimenuitem> from
      <guimenu>Utilities</guimenu> submenu of the <guimenu>Main
      Menu</guimenu>, or by running the command
      <command>gsearch</command> on the command line.  
    </para> 

    <para>
      Note that <application>GNOME Search Tool</application> is just a
      front-end to the UNIX commands <command>find</command> and
      <command>grep</command>. These commands are extremely powerful,
      but not very easy for a new user. <application>GNOME Search
      Tool</application> provides an easy-to-use interface for most
      common uses of these commands. If you need to perform some type
      of search which is not covered by the <application>GNOME Search
      Tool</application>, chances are that you can do it from the
      command line, using <command>find</command> and
      <command>grep</command> with appropriate options. In this case,
      you should read the info pages for these commands, which can be
      done using the <application>GNOME Help Browser</application>.
    </para>
    </sect1>

  <sect1 id="usage"> 
    <title>Usage</title>
    <para> 
      To start a search, you must give the GNOME Search Tool the
      search criteria and the directory to start in. 
    </para> 

   <para>  
      By default, the search starts in the current working directory
      (denoted by period (.)); if the GNOME Search Tool was started from the
      menu, then the current working directory is your home
      directory. You can change the starting directory by entering any
      valid path in the <guilabel>Start in directory</guilabel> field; for
      example, to search through all the files in on your system, enter
      <filename>/</filename> in this field (warning: it will take <emphasis>
	very</emphasis> long time).
   </para> 

   <para> 
      By default, <application>GNOME Search Tool</application>
      also searches through all subdirectories of the given directory;
      you can turn this behavior off using the option <guilabel>Don't
      search subdirectories</guilabel>, as described in <xref
      linkend="criteria">.  
    </para>

   <para> 
      The only search criterion presented by default is the
      <guilabel>Filename</guilabel>. You can use the wildcards *
      (matches any sequence of symbols, including an empty one) and ?
      (matches any single symbol) in this field. For example, to find
      the files with the extension <filename>txt</filename>, enter
      <userinput>*.txt</userinput> in this field; to find all the
      files that start with the letter D, enter
      <filename>D*</filename> (warning: file names are
      case-sensitive!).  You can also specify much more complicated
      search criteria&mdash; see <xref linkend="criteria">.
   </para>
   
   <para> After you have specified the search criteria and starting
   directory, press <guibutton>Start</guibutton>. This will take some time
   (depending on the directory size and system speed), after which
   you will be presented with a window containing the list of all the
   files matching your criteria (it may be empty). If the search is
   taking too much time, you can abort it by pressing
   <guibutton>Stop</guibutton> button. 
   </para>

   <para> In the search results window, you can double-click on any
      file to open it. It will have the same effect as double-clicking
      on this file in a File Manager window&mdash;that is, the file
      will be opened using the default action for this file type. 
    </para> 
    </sect1>
      
  <sect1 id="criteria">
    <title>Search Criteria</title> 

    <para> In addition to the simple filename search described above,
      the GNOME Search Tool allows you to specify other criteria. To do
      so, you should select the appropriate criteria type from the
      drop-down list (located to the left of the
      <guibutton>Add</guibutton> button), and press
      <guibutton>Add</guibutton>. This will add this criterion to the
      already existing ones. <application>GNOME Search
	Tool</application> will search for files meeting
      <emphasis>all</emphasis> of the specified criteria. For example,
      Figure 1 shows search for all files with extension
      <filename>txt</filename> which were modified during the last 7
      days and which contain the word GNOME.
    </para>

   </figure>

    <para>
      You can remove any of the criteria you had previously added by
      pressing <guibutton>Remove</guibutton> button next to it. You can also
      temporarily disable a criterion by unchecking the
      <guibutton>Enable</guibutton> check-button next to it. 
    </para>

    <para> 
      Below is the list of all possible criteria types: 
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para> 
	    <emphasis>Filename</emphasis>  &mdash; search by filename. As
	    usual, you can use the wildcards * and ? in the
	    search. Remember also that UNIX file names are
	    case-sensitive. 
	</para></listitem>

	<listitem>
          <para> <emphasis>Don't search subdirectories</emphasis> - if
           this option is selected, GNOME Search Tool will not search
           the files in the subdirectories of the start directory.
           </para></listitem>

	<listitem><para> 
	    <emphasis>File owner</emphasis>  &mdash; search by the name of
	    the user owning the file.
	</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para> 
	    <emphasis>File owner group</emphasis>  &mdash; search by the name
	    of the group owning the file. 
	</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para> 
	    <emphasis>Last modification time</emphasis>  &mdash; search for
	    files which were modified during the last N days (to be
	    precise, during the last N*24 hours).  
	</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para> <emphasis>Don't search mounted
	  filesystems</emphasis> &mdash; if this option is selected,
	  <application>GNOME Search Tool</application> will only
	  search in the subdirectories which are mounted on the same
	  device (disk) as the starting directory. For example, if the
	  starting directory is <filename>/</filename> and is mounted
	  on <filename>/dev/hda</filename> (first hard drive), and it
	  has a subdirectory <filename>/home</filename> which is
	  mounted on <filename>/dev/hdb</filename> (second hard
	  drive), then <filename>/home</filename> will not be
	  searched. This option can be useful to exclude files on the
	  removable media (CD-ROM, floppy) from the search.
	  </para></listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para> <emphasis>Empty file</emphasis> &mdash; this criterion
	    matches the empty file. Mostly used by system
	    administrators for system maintenance.  
	  </para></listitem>

	<listitem><para> 
	  <emphasis>Invalid user or group</emphasis> &mdash; matches files
	    whose owner or group is not known to the system. This
	    option can be useful when searching for files belonging to
	    users who have been removed from the system. Mostly used
	    by system administrators for system maintenance.   
	</para></listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para> 
	    <emphasis>Filenames except</emphasis> &mdash;
	    matches all files except those whose filename is given. As
	    before, you can use wildcards. For example, if you specify
	    in this field <filename>*~</filename>, <application>GNOME
	    Search Tool</application> will exclude from the search all
	    files with names ending with tilde (~).
	  </para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem><para> 
            <emphasis>Simple substring search</emphasis>
	    &mdash; matches all files that
	    <emphasis>contain</emphasis> given substring. Since this
	    option involves reading contents of every file, it can
	    slow down the search significantly. Note: you can't use
	    wildcards with this option.  
	  </para></listitem>

	<listitem><para> <emphasis>Regular expression
	  search</emphasis> &mdash; matches all files that
	  <emphasis>contain</emphasis> given regular expression.
	  Since this option involves reading contents of every file,
	  it can slow down the search significantly.
	  </para></listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para> 
	    <emphasis>Extended regular expression
	      search</emphasis> &mdash; matches all files that
	    <emphasis>contain</emphasis> given extended regular
	    expression. Since this option involves reading contents of
	    every file, it can slow down the search significantly.
          </para>
	</listitem>

      </itemizedlist>

      For those unfamiliar with the notion of regular expression, let
      us just say that this is an extremely flexible and powerful
      syntax for pattern matching. Unlike simple wildcard matching, it
      allows logical operations (and, or, not), lists of symbols to
      match, checking for a string in the beginning of the line, and
      much more. Detailed description of regular expressions and
      extended regular expressions can be found in the man page for
      <application>grep</application>. New users will probably find it too
      complicated to use, but for more experienced users, regular
      expressions can be very useful.
