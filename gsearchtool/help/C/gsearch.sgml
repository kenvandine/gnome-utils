    <title>Introduction</title> 

    <para>
       <application>GNOME Search Tool</application> is a utility for
       searching files on your system. It can perform many types of
       search: by filename, by modification date, by file contents,
       etc. It is included in the
       <filename>gnome-utils</filename> package, which is a part of
       the GNOME desktop environment. This document describes version
       1.0.50 of <application>GNOME Search Tool</application>.
    </para>

    <para> The search tool can be started by selecting
      <guimenuitem>GNOME Search Tool</guimenuitem> from
      <guimenu>Utilities</guimenu> submenu of the <guimenu>Main
      Menu</guimenu>, or by running the command
      <command>gsearchtool</command> on the command line.  
    </para> 

    <para>
      Note that <application>GNOME Search Tool</application> is just a
      front-end to the UNIX commands <command>find</command>,
      <command>grep</command>, and <command>locate</command>. These
      commands are extremely powerful, but not very easy for a new
      user. <application>GNOME Search Tool</application> provides an
      easy-to-use interface for most common uses of these commands. If
      you need to perform some type of search which is not covered by
      the <application>GNOME Search Tool</application>, chances are
      that you can do it from the command line, using
      <command>find</command> and <command>grep</command> with
      appropriate options. In this case, you should read the info
      pages for these commands, which can be done using the
      <application>GNOME Help Browser</application>.
    </para>
    </sect1>

  <sect1 id="usage"> 
    <title>Usage</title>
    <para>
    <application>GNOME Search Tool</application> provides two types of
    search: <emphasis>Full find</emphasis> and <emphasis>Quick
    find</emphasis>. Full find is reliable and provides many
    possibilities, but can be slow. Quick find uses special technique
    for speeding up search; it is much faster, but can only search by
    filename, and is not as accurate as full find. This section
    describes full find mode; quick find is described in <xref
    linkend="locate">.  
    </para>

</figure>

    <para> 
      To start a search, you must give the GNOME Search Tool the
      search criteria and the directory to start in. 
    </para> 

   <para> By default, the search starts in the current working
      directory; if the <application>GNOME Search Tool</application>
      was started from the menu, then the current working directory is
      your home directory. You can change the starting directory by
      entering any valid path in the <guilabel>Start in
      directory</guilabel> field, or by choosing a directory using the
      <guibutton>Browse...</guibutton> button. For example, to search
      through all the files in on your system, enter
      <filename>/</filename> in this field (warning: it will take
      <emphasis> very</emphasis> long time).  </para>

   <para> By default, <application>GNOME Search Tool</application>
      also searches through all subdirectories of the given directory;
      you can turn this behavior off by enabling the option
      <guilabel>Don't search subdirectories</guilabel>. For finer
      control, you can enable the option <guilabel>Don't search
      mounted filesystems</guilabel>, which will exclude from the
      search subdirectories which are physically located (mounted) on
      drives or partitions other than the starting directory &mdash;
      see <xref linkend="criteria"> for details.
    </para>

   <para> 
      The only search criterion presented by default is the
      <guilabel>Filename</guilabel>. You can use the wildcards
      <keysym>*</keysym> 
      (matches any sequence of symbols, including an empty one) and
      <keysym>?</keysym> 
      (matches any single symbol) in this field. For example, to find
      the files with the extension <filename>txt</filename>, enter
      <userinput>*.txt</userinput> in this field; to find all the
      files that start with the letter D, enter
      <filename>D*</filename> (warning: file names are
      case-sensitive!).  You can also specify much more complicated
      search criteria &mdash; see <xref linkend="criteria">.
   </para>
   
   <para> After you have specified the search criteria and starting
   directory, press <guibutton>Start</guibutton>. This will take some
   time (depending on the directory size and system speed), after
   which you will be presented with a window containing the list of
   all the files matching your criteria (it may be empty), as shown in
   <xref linkend="results">. If the search is taking too much time,
   you can abort it by pressing <guibutton>Stop</guibutton> button.
   </para>

  <screeninfo>Search results window</screeninfo>

</figure>


   <para> In the search results window, you can double-click on any
      file to open it. It will have the same effect as double-clicking
      on this file in a File Manager window &mdash; that is, the file
      will be opened using the default action for this file type. You
      can also save the list of found files  to disk by pressing
      <guibutton>Save</guibutton> button. You wil be prompted for a
      filename to save the list to; the list will be saved in a plain
      text format. 
    </para> 
    </sect1>
      
  <sect1 id="criteria">
    <title>Search Criteria</title> 

    <para> In addition to the simple filename search described above,
      the GNOME Search Tool allows you to specify other criteria. To do
      so, you should select the appropriate criteria type from the
      drop-down list (located to the left of the
      <guibutton>Add</guibutton> button), and press
      <guibutton>Add</guibutton>. This will add this criterion to the
      already existing ones. <application>GNOME Search
	Tool</application> will search for files meeting
      <emphasis>all</emphasis> of the specified criteria. For example,
      <xref linkend="sample"> shows search for all files with extension
      <filename>txt</filename> which were modified during the last 7
      days and which contain the word GNOME.
    </para>

   </figure>

    <para>
      You can remove any of the criteria you had previously added by
      pressing <guibutton>Remove</guibutton> button next to it. You can also
      temporarily disable a criterion by unchecking the
      <guibutton>Enable</guibutton> check-button next to it. 
    </para>

    <para> 
      Below is the list of all possible criteria types: 
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para> 
	    <emphasis>Filename</emphasis>  &mdash; search by filename. As
	    usual, you can use the wildcards * and ? in the
	    search. Remember also that UNIX file names are
	    case-sensitive. 
	</para></listitem>

	<listitem>
          <para> <emphasis>Don't search subdirectories</emphasis> &mdash; if
           this option is selected, GNOME Search Tool will not search
           the files in the subdirectories of the start directory.
           </para></listitem>

	<listitem><para> 
	    <emphasis>File owner</emphasis>  &mdash; search by the name of
	    the user owning the file.
	</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para> 
	    <emphasis>File owner group</emphasis>  &mdash; search by the name
	    of the group owning the file. 
	</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para> 
	    <emphasis>Last modification time</emphasis>  &mdash; search for
	    files which were modified during the last N days (to be
	    precise, during the last N*24 hours).  
	</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para> <emphasis>Don't search mounted
	  filesystems</emphasis> &mdash; if this option is selected,
	  <application>GNOME Search Tool</application> will only
	  search in the subdirectories which are mounted on the same
	  device (disk) as the starting directory. For example, if the
	  starting directory is <filename>/</filename> and is mounted
	  on <filename>/dev/hda</filename> (first hard drive), and it
	  has a subdirectory <filename>/home</filename> which is
	  mounted on <filename>/dev/hdb</filename> (second hard
	  drive), then <filename>/home</filename> will not be
	  searched. This option can be useful to exclude files on the
	  removable media (CD-ROM, floppy) from the search.
	  </para></listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para> <emphasis>Empty file</emphasis> &mdash; this criterion
	    matches the empty file. Mostly used by system
	    administrators for system maintenance.  
	  </para></listitem>

	<listitem><para> 
	  <emphasis>Invalid user or group</emphasis> &mdash; matches files
	    whose owner or group is not known to the system. This
	    option can be useful when searching for files belonging to
	    users who have been removed from the system. Mostly used
	    by system administrators for system maintenance.   
	</para></listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para> 
	    <emphasis>Filenames except</emphasis> &mdash;
	    matches all files except those whose filename is given. As
	    before, you can use wildcards. For example, if you specify
	    in this field <filename>*~</filename>, <application>GNOME
	    Search Tool</application> will exclude from the search all
	    files with names ending with tilde (~).
	  </para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem><para> 
            <emphasis>Simple substring search</emphasis>
	    &mdash; matches all files that
	    <emphasis>contain</emphasis> given substring. Since this
	    option involves reading contents of every file, it can
	    slow down the search significantly. Note: you can't use
	    wildcards with this option.  
	  </para></listitem>

	<listitem><para> <emphasis>Regular expression
	  search</emphasis> &mdash; matches all files that
	  <emphasis>contain</emphasis> given regular expression.
	  Since this option involves reading contents of every file,
	  it can slow down the search significantly.
	  </para></listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para> 
	    <emphasis>Extended regular expression
	      search</emphasis> &mdash; matches all files that
	    <emphasis>contain</emphasis> given extended regular
	    expression. Since this option involves reading contents of
	    every file, it can slow down the search significantly.
          </para>
	</listitem>

      </itemizedlist>

      For those unfamiliar with the notion of regular expression, let
      us just say that this is an extremely flexible and powerful
      syntax for pattern matching. Unlike simple wildcard matching, it
      allows logical operations (and, or, not), lists of symbols to
      match, checking for a string in the beginning of the line, and
      much more. Detailed description of regular expressions and
      extended regular expressions can be found in the man page for
      <application>grep</application>. New users will probably find it too
      complicated to use, but for more experienced users, regular
      expressions can be very useful.
    </para>

  <sect1 id="locate">
    <title>Quick  find mode</title>
    <para> 
      This section describes quick find mode of <application>GNOME
    search tool</application>. To use this mode, switch to
    <guilabel>Quick find (locate)</guilabel> window, shown in <xref
    linkend="locatewin">. 
      </para>

    <figure id="locatewin">
     <title>Quick find window</title>
     <screenshot>
      <screeninfo>Quick find window</screeninfo>
      <graphic format="png" fileref="locate" srccredit="sasha">
      </graphic>
    </screenshot>
   </figure>

    <para> In the quick search mode, <application>GNOME Search
      tool</application> doesn not actually search for a file on the
      disk &mdash; instead, it uses a special database containing the
      names of all the files on the system. It makes search much
      faster. However, it also means that the only type of search you
      can do is by filename. Moreover, this search will not find files
      which were added after the last database update (on most
      systems, it is updated daily, usually at night &mdash; see below
      for more info).
    </para>
    <para> To find a file using the quick search mode, just enter a
      substring of the file name in the <guilabel>Locate
      file</guilabel> field. For example, to find all the files whose
      filenames contain the string "searchtool", enter
      <userinput>searchtool</userinput> in this field. This will also
      show all the files that contain the string "searchtool" in their
      full pathname &mdash; in particular, all the files in <filename
      class="directory">/usr/share/help/gsearchtool</filename>.
    </para>
    <para> To restrict search to a subdirectory, you can use the
      directory name in combination with the wildcards. For example,
      to do quick search for all files with extension
      <filename>txt</filename> in the directory <filename
      class="directory">/home/user</filename>, enter <userinput>
      /home/user/*.txt</userinput> in the <guilabel>Locate
      file</guilabel> field.
    </para>

    <para>The quick search mode is actually a front-end to <command>locate
      </command> command, so if you need more detailed information,
      read the appropriate manual page. 
    </para>
    <sect2 id="locatedb">
      <title> The locate database</title>
      <para>
	This section discusses updating the database used for quick
	search. Unless you are a system administrator or just curious,
	you do not need to read it. 
      </para>
      <para>
	On most systems, the database used for locate command (and
	thus, for quick search mode of GNOME Search tool), is updated
	daily, usually at nights. This is done as a
	<command>cron</command> job &mdash; see the manual page for
	<command>cron</command> if you are unfamiliar with this
	utility. Note that if your computer is usually turned off at
	night time, the database doesn't get updated. In this case,
	you should change the default update time by either manully
	editing <filename>/etc/crontab</filename> or using a graphical
	tool such as <application>cromagnon</application>. This
	requires system administrator (root) privileges. 
      </para>

      <para>You can also issue the command "Update databse now" by
      running the command <command>updatedb</command>. Again, this
      requires system administrator (root) privileges. Without any
      options, it rebuilds the whole database, for all the files on
      your system. It also has many command line options allowing you
      to fine-tune it (for example, istructing it to skip certain
      directories). For more information, read the manual page for
      <command>updatedb</command>.
