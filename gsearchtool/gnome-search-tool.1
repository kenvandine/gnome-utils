.SH DESCRIPTION
.B GNOME Search Tool
is a utility for finding files on your system. To perform a
basic search, you can type a filename or a partial filename,
with or without wildcards. To refine your search, you can
apply additional search options.

.B GNOME Search Tool
uses the find, grep, and locate UNIX commands. The case
sensitivity of the search depends on your operating
system. For example, on Linux, the find, grep, and locate
commands support the -i option, so all searches are
case-insensitive.

For full documentation see the
.B GNOME Search Tool
online help.
