GNOME-Entry in the libgnomeui library will be removed from the GNOME
software stack [1].  At this time, a replacement for the GNOME Entry 
widget has not been added to GTK+.  The code in this directory
is based on a widget from the gedit source code.

The bugzilla report at bugs.gnome.org is #161483, "gtk-combo-box-entry
missing a history feature".
