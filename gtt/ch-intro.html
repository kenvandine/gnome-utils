1.1 Feedback
</h2></A>
Well, I'm german and I find it hard to express myself in english. So if
you find some phrases and/or words that I used in a wrong way (and you will
find them :-) ), please send me a mail, to let me correct this. Please send
me notes about typos, too.
<P>
And I would like to hear about your opionion on GTimeTracker. Maybe you
want some features to be integrated in GTimeTracker. Or you have discovered
a bug. Or you think, that the user interface needs a change in some way.
Just send me a mail, and I will see, what I can do for you. I want to make
this tool usable and usefull for everyone.

1.2 What is GTimeTracker
</h2></A>
Basically GTimeTracker is just a tool to measure the time, you let a
given <em>project</em> (see <A href="ch-main.html#s-projwhat">What is a Project, subsection 2.3.1</A>) in a <em>selected</em> state (see
<A href="ch-main.html#s-projstates">The State of a Project, subsection 2.3.2</A>). GTimeTracker isn't espacially smart at this. You,
the user, will have to give GTimeTracker hints about what you're currently
wanting to measure or it will not display reasonable values.
<P>
But when one has learned to use GTimeTracker effectively, it can be of
great help. For example you can use it to optimize your work. It can show
you, that you are spending to much time on unimportent tasks. Or it can
exactly count the hours you spend on a project, that is payed for by time.
You may discover many other ways, GTimeTracker can work for you.

<A name="s-start"><h2>
1.3 First starting GTimeTracker
</h2></A>
After first starting GTimeTracker you will be notified, that there is no
readable configuration file in your home directory
(<code>$HOME/.gtimetrackerrc</code>). You will be asked, whether or not you want
GTimeTracker to install a new one. This is a safety question, because
something could have happend that made your configuration file unreadable
and maybe you will want to look for it yourself. Writing a new config file
will cause the loss of all your projects and time measurements. If you
started GTimeTracker for the first time, you can just press the <code>OK</code>
button.
