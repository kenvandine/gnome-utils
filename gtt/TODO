The status bar looks ugly. And it should show more info. Maybe switch
to GtkStatusbar - depends on how flexible that is.

An option to let the tooltips be displayed in the status bar.

Output to log file needs to be tested a bit. I should save the
last_real_logged_project to avoid duplicates.

Configuration file needs to be gnomefied.

Toolbar settings in help window should be saved.

Toolbar in GTT should be configurable. At least should be able to
disable groups of toolbar buttons (Cut, Copy, Paste -- or Save, Reload
-- or what have you).



Most likely not in 1.0:
=======================

Networked version (Server on one mashine -- all others are network clients).
Security (but read-only for some users). Viewable / editable on multiple
mashines at the same time.
