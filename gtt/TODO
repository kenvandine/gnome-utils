An option to let the tooltips be displayed in the status bar.

I should use CList. That would make the list sortable in a good way.

Changing the toolbar is very ugly. I cannot remove or add toolbar
icons as needed, but have to build a new toolbar each time icons are
added/removed. Additionally I always get segfaults when I destroy
widgets - therfore I just hide the old toolbar. That consumes some
bytes every time.



Most likely not in 1.0:
=======================

Networked version (Server on one mashine -- all others are network clients).
Security (but read-only for some users). Viewable / editable on multiple
mashines at the same time.
