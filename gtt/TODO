Add an gtt panel applet for switching projects fast.

Documentation has to be updated/finished.

Optionally allow more then one running project.

Support some SQL database for logging?

Create bonobo component to allow tasks to be put into calander (e.g.
evolution calender).

Inactivity timeout works. Just need to hook it up to preferences dialog ...


Later:
~~~~~~
Networked version (Server on one machine -- all others are network clients).
Security (but read-only for some users). Viewable / editable on multiple
machines at the same time.


bugs
----
During read of data,  don't destroy old project list until we are sure 
that read of new project list succeeded.

export is broken with new heirarchy (should be stripped, in favour 
of 'print'?)

fix annoying cursor shape when dragging projects around

auto-save every xxx minutes

grep for xxx fixme hack alert for additional todo items ... 

implement tooltips when there is a hover over url link

implement 'print' journal for html window ...

add dialogs for suggested auto-merge intervals when the default values 
are too small (should be 60/300/300, not 3/60/60)

build fancier reports/journals, including 
-- fancier, nicer layout for invoice 
   (including configurable values for printed enums)
-- handle embedded gif/png/jpg

support for 'minimum billing blocks' is everywhere, exept in the actual invoice
report. Add it there.

bug: on project properties, clicking 'close' accepts the changes,
instead of rejecting them. This seems to be a gnome dialog thing.
I think we need a 'reject' button ... 

when no timers are running, then day totals are not reset at midnight.
