Kinda Bugs:
===========

When using GnomeApp, some toolbar features are still missing.

Output to log file needs to be tested a bit.

Documentation!

The status bar looks ugly. And it should show more info.



Features:
=========

Gnomify GTT (partly finished)

Current selected should be saved? Maybe optional?

Networked version (Server on one mashine -- all other are network
clients). Security (but read-only for some users). Viewable /
editable on multiple mashines.
