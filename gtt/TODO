An option to let the tooltips be displayed in the status bar.

Toolbar in GTT should be configurable. At least should be able to
disable groups of toolbar buttons (Cut, Copy, Paste -- or Save, Reload
-- or what have you).

Configuration file needs to be gnomefied.

Toolbar settings in help window should be saved. But I may skip this,
because GttHelp is just a temporary hack until a real GnomeHelp is
coded.

I should use CList. That would make the list sortable in a good way.



Most likely not in 1.0:
=======================

Networked version (Server on one mashine -- all others are network clients).
Security (but read-only for some users). Viewable / editable on multiple
mashines at the same time.
