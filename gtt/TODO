Kinda Bugs:
===========

I haven't finished to include support GnomeApp.

Documentation!



Features:
=========

Gnomify GTT (partly finished)

Output to log file.

Current selected project should be displayed in a status bar. Possibly with
a total time of all projects or total time of the selected project.

Current selected should be saved? Maybe optional?

Networked version (Server on one mashine -- all other are network
clients). Security (but read-only for some users). Viewable /
editable on multiple mashines.
