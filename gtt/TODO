Kinda Bugs:
===========

Use of GtkToolbar widget. So I don't have to maintain two versions of
toolbars.

Output to log file needs to be tested a bit.

The status bar looks ugly. And it should show more info.



Features:
=========

Configuration file needs to be gnomefied.



Future:
=======

Networked version (Server on one mashine -- all others are network clients).
Security (but read-only for some users). Viewable / editable on multiple
mashines at the same time.
