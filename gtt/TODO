bugs
----
During read of data,  don't destroy old project list until we are sure 
that read of new project list succeeded.

export is broken with new heirarchy (should be stripped, in favour 
of 'print'?)

config_show_tb_journal should be configurable/savable

fix annoying cursor shape when dragging projects around

auto-save every xxx minutes

grep for xxx fixme hack alert for additional todo items ... 

implement tooltips when there is a hover over url link

implement ability to remove task from journal

implement 'print' journal for html window ...

add dialogs for suggested auto-merge intervals when the default values 
are too small (should be 60/300/300, not 3/60/60)

build fancier reports/journals, including 
-- fancier, nicer layout for invoice (including configurable column titles)
-- handle embedded gif/png/jpg

support for 'minimum billing blocks' is everywhere, exept in the actual invoice
