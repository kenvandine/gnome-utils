Use of GtkToolbar widget. So I don't have to maintain two versions of
toolbars.

The status bar looks ugly. And it should show more info. Maybe switch
to GtkStatusbar - depends on how flexible that is.

An option to let the tooltips be displayed in the status bar.

Output to log file needs to be tested a bit.

Configuration file needs to be gnomefied.

Initial "config file error" dialog needs to be redesigned. And it
shouldn't popup just because GTT is run for the first time.

Process more WM_DELETE_WINDOW events.


Most likely not in 1.0:
=======================

Networked version (Server on one mashine -- all others are network clients).
Security (but read-only for some users). Viewable / editable on multiple
mashines at the same time.
