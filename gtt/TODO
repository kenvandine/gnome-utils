Bugs -- High Priority
---------------------
implement 'print' journal for html window ...

xxxgtk_text_get_text() and its sister are just plain wrong, and lead to garbage.
This occures in 'notes' part of dialogs ...

support for 'minimum billing blocks' is everywhere, exept in the actual invoice
report. Add it there.

fix annoying cursor shape when dragging projects around

export is broken with new heirarchy. Should probably be 
reworked to use ghtml infrastructure, and output to file, 
instead of html viewer.  That way user gets total flexibility 
over export formats.

Bugs -- Low Priority
--------------------

During read of data,  don't destroy old project list until we are sure 
that read of new project list succeeded.

auto-save every xxx minutes

grep for xxx fixme hack alert for additional todo items ... 

implement tooltips when there is a hover over url link

add dialogs for suggested auto-merge intervals when the default values 
are too small (should be 60/300/300, not 3/60/60)

build fancier reports/journals, including 
-- fancier, nicer layout for invoice 
   (including configurable values for printed enums)
-- handle embedded gif/png/jpg

the log file should be gziped on write.
