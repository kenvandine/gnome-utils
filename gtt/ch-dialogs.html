The Dialogs
</h1>
<hr>
<A name="s-pref"><h2>
3.1 The Preferences Dialog
</h2></A>
<hr>
<A name="s-display"><h3>
3.1.1 Display
</h3></A>
You can select, what GTimeTracker should display in the main window,
here.

<dl>
<dt><code>Show Seconds</code>
  <dd>You can tell GTimeTracker, if you want the seconds to be displayed
  in the project list. If seconds are shown, the time displayed in the
  project list looks like <code>00:12:47</code> (hours:minutes:seconds). If not, you
  just see <code>00:12</code> (hours:minutes).

  <p><dt><code>Show Toolbar Icons</code> and <code>Show Toolbar Texts</code>
  <dd>If you're using a GNOME version of GTimeTracker, you can select how
  the toolbar should look. You can chosse to display icons and/or a text.

  <p><dt><code>Show Status Bar</code>
  <dd>Just choose, if you want the status bar to be displayed.
  <p></dl>



<hr>
<A name="s-shellcmd"><h3>
3.1.2 Shell Commands
</h3></A>
<dl>
<dt><code>Switch Project Command</code>

    <dd>This shell command will be executed every time you select a
    project, which was previously unselected. If you use <code>%s</code> in this
    command, GTimeTracker will replace that by the title of the selected
    project. I use the following entry to update my <code>.project</code> file:

    <pre>echo '%s' &gt;~/.project</pre>

  <p><dt><code>No Project Command</code>
  
    <dd>This shell command will be executed every time you deselect a
    project or if you exit GTimeTracker. To complete the example above, I
    use this command:
    
    <pre>rm -f ~/.project</pre>
<p></dl>



<hr>
<A name="s-logfile"><h3>
3.1.3 Logfile
</h3></A>
<dl>
<dt><code>Use Logfile</code>
  
    <dd>You have to enable this, if you want a logfile.
    
  <p><dt><code>Filename</code>
  
    <dd>Give a filename for the logfile. GTimeTracker currently does not
    replace <code>$HOME</code> or <code>~</code>. You should give the complete path to the
    logfile.
    
  <p><dt><code>Timeout in secs</code>

    <dd>This value represents the minimum time a project has to be
    selected, before it will be logged. This is usefull, when you don't want
    any small task to be logged, or when you clicked on the wrong project
    first. Let's say, you just wanted to start working on a letter to your
    friend Joe (so you selected the project <em>Letter to Joe</em>), but that
    reminds you, that you have to prepare a list of Christmas presents first
    (Joe has asked you to give him some good ideas). So you switch to the
    project <em>X-Mas presents</em>. You wouldn't want the project <em>Letter to
    Joe</em> to be in your logfile, because you didn't really start it yet. I
    would suggest you set this value at least to 10 seconds.
<p></dl>

<P>
Note that a project will not get logged, before you either quit
GTimeTracker, switch to another project, or deselct that project. So don't
be confused when you look at your logfile and your current project still
isn't listed, even if it is running since two hours.


<hr>
<A name="s-ok-apply-cancel"><h3>
3.1.4 <code>OK</code>, <code>apply</code> and <code>Cancel</code>
</h3></A>
If you are pleased with the values of the dialog, press <code>OK</code> to make
them active and have the dialog go away.
<P>
If you want to apply these values just for a given task and plan to
reopen the dialog again, you can press on <code>Apply</code> to activate the values.
But the dialog will remain open.
<P>
If you don't want to change to working values, you just press
<code>Cancel</code>. That will close the dialog, but will not change the behavier of
GTimeTracker in any way. I recommend using <code>Cancel</code> even if you didn't
change anything.




<hr>
<A name="s-prop"><h2>
3.2 The Properties Dialog
</h2></A>
This dialog shows you all values that are internally stored with a
project.
<P>
Note that this is the only way to examine the overall time yet.

<dl>
<dt><code>Project Title</code>
  
    <dd>You can change the title of a project here.
    
  <p><dt><code>Project Description</code>
  
    <dd>You can give the project a more detailed description if you like.
    Up to now this value will never be used by GTimeTracker
    
  <p><dt><code>Project Time today</code>
  
    <dd>This is the <em>daily</em> time, you worked on the project today. You
    can edit this time here.
    
  <p><dt><code>Project Time ever</code>
  
    <dd>This is the <em>total</em> time, you worked on a project. You can edit
    this time here.
<p></dl>

<P>
See <A href="#s-ok-apply-cancel"><code>OK</code>, <code>apply</code> and <code>Cancel</code>, subsection 3.1.4</A> for the meaning of the buttons at the
bottom of the dialog.



<hr>
<A name="s-newproj"><h2>
3.3 The New Project Dialog
</h2></A>
This dialog is fairly small. It just wants to know, how you want to
entitle the new project. Just enter a title of the new project and press
<code>OK</code>, if you are satisfied. Or press <code>Cancel</code> if you changed your mind
and don't want GTimeTracker to add a new project.
