1998-02-13  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* toolbar.c (add_stock_button): Bad hack: force-realize the window
	so that the pixmaps will use the correct visual.  The toolbar
	still has an incorrect size --- Gnome-stock has to be fixed for this.

	* menus.c: Updated g_string_hash and g_string_equal by g_str_hash
	and g_str_equal, respectively.

1998-02-12  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* main.c: Added #include <locale.h>

Wed Feb 11 23:29:44 CET 1998  Eckehard Berns  <eb@berns.prima.de>

	* gtt.1: added a man page for gtt.

Sun Feb  8 03:11:04 1998  Eckehard Berns  <eb@berns.prima.de>

	* gtthelp.c (gtt_help_init_menu): changed the `close' menu item to
 	  use gnome_stock_menu_item for demonstration purposes.

Wed Feb  4 01:32:49 1998  Eckehard Berns  <eb@berns.prima.de>

	* gtthelp.c: added use of gnome_stock_pixmap_register to let the
 	  API do the dirty work about the proper state settings of the
 	  `back' and `forward' icons.

	* timer.c (timer_func): oops, big bug: when the timer has been
	  stopped and restarted again, timer_func added all the seconds,
	  the timer was stoppen (due to the last_timer counter). This has
	  been fixed now.

Sat Jan 31 11:37:57 1998  Eckehard Berns  <eb@berns.prima.de>

	* app.c (app_new): call gtk_window_set_wmclass added

Fri Jan 30 00:20:59 1998  Eckehard Berns  <eb@berns.prima.de>

	* timer.c (timer_func): oops, wrong diff_time...

	* clist.c,proj.c: one can sort the list, if GtkCList is used.

	* options.c,toolbar.c: added option to show/hide tooltips.

	* clist.c: added this file. added support for GtkCList throughout
	  the sources.

	* timer.c (timer_func): don't know if it really matters, but I
 	  check the time that is elapsed since the last timer event. This
 	  ensures that I don't miss any second.

1998-01-28  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Misc fixes.

Wed Jan 28 15:37:55 1998  Eckehard Berns  <eb@berns.prima.de>

	* menucmd.c (about_box): I'm now using GnomeAbout.

Tue Jan 27 08:31:01 1998  Eckehard Berns  <eb@berns.prima.de>

	* toolbar.c (build_toolbar): changed dgettext to gtt_gettext and
 	  added a prefix to "New". That way I don't need my own domain
 	  _and_ have no ambiguities.

1998-01-26  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.am (LDADD): added $(DL_LIB) since these are now
	required for any user of libgnome.a.
	
Mon Jan 26 14:25:17 1998  Eckehard Berns  <eb@berns.prima.de>

	* {options,prop}.c: used gnome_stock_button for the dialogs.

	* toolbar.c (build_toolbar): replaced _("New") with
 	  dgettext("gtt", "New") to distinguish my "New" with the one of
 	  gnomine.

Sun Jan 25 03:36:25 1998  Eckehard Berns  <eb@berns.prima.de>

	* gtthelp.c: gnome_config'ed the GttHelp settings.

	* proj.c: I'm using gnome config now. If no gnome config is found,
 	  a fallback to the old (and non-GNOME) config file is used to
 	  convert old config files.

	* added support to shorten the toolbar by choosing `toolbar
 	  sections'. This includes some not so pretty gtk_widget_hides
 	  (instead of _destroys), and some hacks around gnome_app. But I
 	  think, it's worth it.

1998-01-25  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* gtt-db.sgml: translated Eckehard's debiandoc SGML into DocBook.
	Checked in gtt-db.sgml and the html output.

Sat Jan 24 13:35:15 1998  Eckehard Berns  <eb@berns.prima.de>

	* app.c: changed the statusbar to be a GtkStatusbar (looks better)

Wed Jan 21 18:11:39 1998  Eckehard Berns  <eb@berns.prima.de>

	* log.c (log_proj_intern): added last_real_proj to avoid duplicate
 	  log file enrties.

Tue Jan 20 22:43:29 1998  Eckehard Berns  <eb@berns.prima.de>

	* gtthelp.[ch]: added Options->Show Tooltips to GttHelp

Tue Jan 20 02:03:29 1998  Eckehard Berns  <eb@berns.prima.de>

	* app.c (init_list): checked for ENOENT - no configuration file is
 	  no error

	* proj.c (project_list_load): checked for ENOENT

	* gtthelp.c: Added a toolbar. Added a menu to configure the
 	  toolbar. These toolbar settings still need to be saved.

Mon Jan 19 22:24:13 1998  Eckehard Berns  <eb@berns.prima.de>

	* prop.c (prop_dialog): signal_connected delete_event to
 	  gtt_delete_event

	* options.c (options_dialog): signal_connected delete_event to
 	  gtt_delete_event, which actiually just hides the widget

	* app.c: eliminated segfault bug by not destroying any GnomeApp
 	  (GTT's main window and GttHelp).

	* gtthelp.c: added history. Found out about
 	  XmHTMLAnchorScrollToName. I still do not use it because it is
 	  not converted to gtk yet. Found the segfault bug - seems to be a
 	  problem with free/malloc in my libc or in gtk - I worked around
 	  it by not destroying anything.

Mon Jan 19 15:52:46 1998 MET  Eckehard Berns  <eb@berns.prima.de>

	* made gtt use gnome-stock.[ch]
	
Mon Jan 19 01:34:13 1998  Eckehard Berns  <eb@berns.prima.de>

	* dialog.c (new_dialog): included GtkDialog support when
 	  GTK_USE_DIALOG is set.

	* Fixed some style bugs. Added some "delete_event"s.

	* toolbar.c: revamped completely. when using GtkToolbar, widgets
 	  get updated now.
	  
	  Added support for gnome-stock.[ch], which I'm develeping at this
 	  time.

	* prior to this I added many things to GTT, I do not remember
 	  exactly (that's why I started this ChangeLog :-) ).All changes,
 	  the user might see, are covered in NEWS though.

Tue Jan 13 17:13:26 1998  Federico Mena  <federico@bananoid.nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* timer.c: #include <string.h>
	* main.c: #include <string.h>
