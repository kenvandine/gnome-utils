	* dialog.c (new_dialog): included GtkDialog support when
 	  GTK_USE_DIALOG is set.

	* Fixed some style bugs. Added some "delete_event"s.

	* toolbar.c: revamped completely. when using GtkToolbar, widgets
 	  get updated now.
	  
	  Added support for gnome-stock.[ch], which I'm develeping at this
 	  time.

	* prior to this I added many things to GTT, I do not remember
 	  exactly (that's why I started this ChangeLog :-) ).All changes,
 	  the user might see, are covered in NEWS though.
