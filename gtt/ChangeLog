	* app.c (init_list): checked for ENOENT - no configuration file is
 	  no error

	* proj.c (project_list_load): checked for ENOENT

	* gtthelp.c: Added a toolbar. Added a menu to configure the
 	  toolbar. These toolbar settings still need to be saved.

	* prop.c (prop_dialog): signal_connected delete_event to
 	  gtt_delete_event

	* options.c (options_dialog): signal_connected delete_event to
 	  gtt_delete_event, which actiually just hides the widget

	* app.c: eliminated segfault bug by not destroying any GnomeApp
 	  (GTT's main window and GttHelp).

	* gtthelp.c: added history. Found out about
 	  XmHTMLAnchorScrollToName. I still do not use it because it is
 	  not converted to gtk yet. Found the segfault bug - seems to be a
 	  problem with free/malloc in my libc or in gtk - I worked around
 	  it by not destroying anything.

	* dialog.c (new_dialog): included GtkDialog support when
 	  GTK_USE_DIALOG is set.

	* Fixed some style bugs. Added some "delete_event"s.

	* toolbar.c: revamped completely. when using GtkToolbar, widgets
 	  get updated now.
	  
	  Added support for gnome-stock.[ch], which I'm develeping at this
 	  time.

	* prior to this I added many things to GTT, I do not remember
 	  exactly (that's why I started this ChangeLog :-) ).All changes,
 	  the user might see, are covered in NEWS though.
