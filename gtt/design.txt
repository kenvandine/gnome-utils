Design Quickie Overview
-----------------------

Project data is pretty-much isolated from the rest of the 
code, in the proj.c file.  The structures are not visible,
and are kept private, in proj_p.h.  This should allow the
project data to be more easily interfaced to things like SQL
databases.  The structures are also GUI (gtk/gnome) independent,
which should also allow them to be used inside of e.g. cgi-bins.

Project data is saved in an XML file format: see
xml-read.c and xml-write.c

Journals are displayed as html by the gtkhtml widget.  The
generation of the html output has been abstracted so that
it could be piped to anything (e.g. to a cgi-bin).
