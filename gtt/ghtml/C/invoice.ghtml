<h1>Invoice for <?scm (gtt-show-project-title) ?> - <?scm (gtt-show-project-desc) ?></h1>

This is a sample invoice
It only shows billable and no-charge hours.
<br><br>
The displayed columns, and the order in which they are displayed,
can be changed by making a copy of the file "invoice.ghtml"
(probably in /usr/share/gtt/ghtml/C/invoice.ghtml) 
and editing the copy to suit your needs.  When finished, you can 
add the new copy to your system by picking 
the menu item "Reports... New Report".
<br><br>

<!--
<?scm (gtt-show-invoice '($memo $billable $billrate $task_time $value $bill_value 
$start_datime $stop_datime $elapsed)) ?>
-->

<?scm (gtt-show-invoice '($memo $task_time $billable $billrate $value $bill_value))  ?>

<br><br>
That's all Folks!
