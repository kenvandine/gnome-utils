Okay, I haven't really finished the documentation. So this incomplete README
is all you get. But you might want to check out
http://www.i-s-o.net/~ecki/gtt/ for more info and news on GTimeTracker.

COPYING for more details.



What is GTimeTracker
====================

GTimeTracker basically just messures the time you spend on a given project
or task. You can setup any number of projects and tell GTimeTracker, which
project you're currently working on. On each new day GTimeTracker will clear
the time on all projects (but will keep an overall time).



What you need to compile GTimeTracker
=====================================

GTimeTracker needs the X11R6 libraries. It also needs GTK/GDK libraries. GTK
is an X Toolkit, that was originally written for GIMP, the famouse imaging
software. You can get it from http://www.gimp.org/gtk/.

If you wish to include support for The GNOME Project you will need at least
version 0.10.0 of the GNOME libraries libgnome and libgnomeui. I do not need
any guile or such yet.

If you do not have those libraries, and you are running a i386 linux box
with ELF support, you might want to get the precompiles static ELF binary.
It is available from http://www.i-s-o.net/~ecki/gtt/index.html#download.



Installation
============

If all goes well, you just have to start "./configure" and than do a "make",
followed by a "make install". This will install an executable called "gtt"
in /usr/local/bin.

There are some things you can twist. You can choose whether or not to
include GNOME support (for more info on The GNOME Project see
http://www.gnome.org). The default is to include GNOME support if the
configure script can find the libraries needed, and to exclude it if not.
You can disable GNOME support by adding "--disable-gnome" to the command
line of "./configure".

You may want to have a look at the file features.h.
