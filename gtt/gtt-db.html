>Well, I'm German and I find it hard to express myself in
	English. So if you find some phrases and/or words that I used
	in a wrong way (and you will find them :-) ), please send me an
	email, so I may correct this. Please send me notes about
	typos, too.</P
><P
>And I would like to hear about your opionion on
	GTimeTracker. Maybe you want some features to be integrated in
	GTimeTracker. Or you have discovered a bug. Or you think, that
	the user interface needs a change in some way. Just send me an
	email and I will see what I can do for you. I want to make
	this tool usable and usefull for everyone.</P
><HR><H1
><A
NAME="WHATIS"
>What is GTimeTracker</A
></H1
><P
>GTimeTracker is a tool to measure the time
	you have a given <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>project</I
> (see <A
HREF="#PROJWHAT"
>the section called <I
>What is a Project</I
> in Chapter 2</A
>)
	in a <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>selected</I
> state (see <A
HREF="#PROJSTATES"
>the section called <I
>The State of a Project</I
> in Chapter 2</A
>).
	GTimeTracker isn't especially smart at this. You, the user,
	will have to give GTimeTracker hints about what you
	currently want it to measure or it will not display reasonable
	values.</P
><P
>Once one has learned to use GTimeTracker effectively,
	it can be of great help. For example, you can use it to
	optimize your work. It can show you that you are spending too
	much time on unimportent tasks. Or, it can exactly count the
	hours you spend on a project that is paid for by time. You
	may discover many other ways GTimeTracker can work for
	you.</P
><HR><H1

NAME="MAIN"
>Chapter 2. The Main Window</A
></H1
><P
>The main window consists of four areas. There is a menu bar
      (see <A
HREF="#MENUBAR"
>the section called <I
>The Menu Bar</I
></A
>), a toolbar (see <A
HREF="#TOOLBAR"
>the section called <I
>The Toolbar</I
></A
>),
      a status bar at the bottom of the window (see <A
HREF="#STATUSBAR"
>the section called <I
>The Status Bar</I
></A
>),
      and a scrollable area where all your projects will be displayed (see
      <A
HREF="#PROJLIST"
>the section called <I
>The Project List</I
></A
>). When you start GTimeTracker for the
      first time, this area will show just one project, which is
      titled "empty".</P
><P
>Note that you can customize the look of the main window in the
      preferences dialog (see <A
HREF="#PREF"
>the section called <I
>The Preferences Dialog</I
> in Chapter 3</A
>), so not all these areas
      might show up after you have played around with GTimeTracker a bit. You
      can always enable missing areas in the preferences dialog.</P
><HR><H1
><A
NAME="MENUBAR"
>The Menu Bar</A
></H1
><P
>The menu bar is located at the top of the window by default. You
      can change the location of the menu bar in numerous ways. This
      customization of the menu bar is subject of the GNOME global
      documentation and not covered here.</P
><P
>Nearly all menu items in GTimeTracker have a shortcut (or
      accelerator key). Those key sequences are shown behind the name of the
      function. If for example you want to activate the function
      <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>New Project...</TT
> &#62; from the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>File</TT
> menu, you can just
      hold down the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Control</TT
> key and press the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>N</TT
> key. In
      the menu this is shown as <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Ctl+N</TT
>.</P
><P
>The menu bar consists of four menus: <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>File</TT
>,
      <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Edit</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Timer</TT
> and <TT

CLASS="LITERAL"
>File</TT
> menu you will find the functions dealing

CLASS="LITERAL"
>$HOME/.gnome/gtt</TT
>.
	In addition there is a function to quit GTimeTracker. I have also
	put the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>New Project...</TT
> funtion there. This is mainly
	because nearly all software has a <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>new</I
> function in the
	<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

	it.</P

>) and about your list of
	  projects (see <A

>.</P
><P
>The configuration file will be saved every time
	  GTimeTracker exits. I have made some effort to verify that this
	  file will be updated even in case of program aborts. So there
	  should be no need to save the configuration file for safety
	  purposes. But you might want to rearrange your projects a bit. You
	  may want to save the current state of the projects just to make
	  sure you cannot delete a project by accident.</P
><P
>In case you made some mistakes you can then use the
	  <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Reload Configuration File</TT
> function. You will be
	  asked if you really want to discard your current set of projects.
	  Just press <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>OK</TT

	  configuration file. If you activated this function by accident,
