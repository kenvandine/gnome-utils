GTimeTracker Documentation - chapter 2<br>
The Main Window
</h1>
The main window consists of four areas. There is a menu bar (see <A href="#s-menubar">The Menu Bar, section 2.1</A>), a toolbar (see <A href="#s-toolbar">The Toolbar, section 2.2</A>), a status bar at the
bottom of the window (see <A href="#s-statusbar">The Status Bar, section 2.4</A>), and a scrollable area where
all your projects will be displayed (see <A href="#s-projlist">The Project List, section 2.3</A>). When you
start GTimeTracker for the first time, this area will show just one project,
which is titled &quot;empty&quot;.
<P>
Note that you can customize the look of the main window in the
preferences dialog (see <A href="ch-dialogs.html#s-pref">The Preferences Dialog, section 3.1</A>), so not all these areas might show
up after you have played around with GTimeTracker a bit. You can allways
enable missing areas in the preferences dialog.

<hr>
<A name="s-menubar"><h2>
2.1 The Menu Bar
</h2></A>
The menu bar is located at the top of the window by default. If you
are using a GNOME version of GTimeTracker, you can change the location of
the menu bar in numerouse ways. This customization of the menu bar is
subject of the GNOME global documentation and not covered here.
<P>
Nearly all menu items in GTimeTracker have a shortcut (or accelerator
key). Those key sequences are shown behind the name of the function. If for
example you want to activate the function <code>New Project...</code> from the
<code>File</code> menu, you can just hold down the <code>Control</code> key and press the
<code>N</code> key. In the menu this is shown as <code>Ctl+N</code>.
<P>
The menu bar consists of four menus: <code>File</code>, <code>Edit</code>, <code>Timer</code> and
<code>Help</code>. I will describe these menus in the following sections.


<hr>
<A name="s-filemenu"><h3>
2.1.1 The <code>File</code> Menu
</h3></A>
In the <code>File</code> menu you will find the functions dealing with the
configuration file -- <code>$HOME/.gtimetrackerrc</code>. In addition
there is a function to quit GTimeTracker. I have also put the <code>New
Project...</code> funtion there. This is mainly because nearly all software has a
<em>new</em> function in the <code>File</code> menu and that's the place I would search
for it.


<hr>
<A name="s-filemenu-newproj"><h4>
2.1.1.1 <code>New Project...</code>
</h4></A>
This function shows the <em>New Project Dialog</em>. Have a look at <A href="ch-dialogs.html#s-newproj">The New Project Dialog, section 3.3</A> for more info.

<hr>
<A name="s-filemenu-rc"><h4>
2.1.1.2 <code>Reload</code> and <code>Save Configuration File</code>
</h4></A>
Okay, let's have a look at the functions dealing with the configuration
file. The configuration file holds infos about your preferences (see <A href="ch-dialogs.html#s-pref">The Preferences Dialog, section 3.1</A>) and about your list of projects (see <A href="#s-projlist">The Project List, section 2.3</A>). The
functions are <code>Reload Configuration File</code> and <code>Save Configuration
File</code>.
<P>
The configuration file will be saved every time, GTimeTracker exits. I
have made some effort, to verify that this file will be updated even in case
of program aborts. So there should be no need to save the configuration file
for safety purpose. But you might want to rearrange your projects a bit. You
may want to save the current state of the projects just to make sure you
cannot delete a project by accident.
<P>
In case you made some mistakes you can then use the <code>Reload
Configuration File</code> function. You will be asked, if you really want to
discard your current set of projects. Just press <code>OK</code>, if you really ment
to reload the old configuration file. If you activated this function by
accident, you can press <code>Cancel</code>.

<hr>
<A name="s-filemenu-quit"><h4>
2.1.1.3 <code>Quit</code>
</h4></A>
This function just quits GTimeTracker. The configuration file with your
current list of projects will automatically be saved.



<hr>
<A name="s-editmenu"><h3>
2.1.2 The <code>Edit</code> Menu
</h3></A>
The <code>Edit</code> menu holds all the functions to edit the project list.
In addition there is a menu item to activate the <em>preferences dialog</em>.

<hr>
<A name="s-editmenu-cut"><h4>
2.1.2.1 <code>Cut</code>, <code>Copy</code> and <code>Paste</code>
</h4></A>
These functions are usefull to rearrange your project list. You can use
<code>Cut</code> to remove projects from the list. But these cutted projects aren't
discarted right away. You can use <code>Paste</code> to insert a <em>cutted</em> or
<em>copied</em> project either before the current selected project, or, if no
project is selected, at the bottom of your project list. The <code>Copy</code>
function does the same as the <code>Cut</code> function, but will not remove the
project from the list.
<P>
Note that there is only room for <em>one</em> project to be <em>cutted</em> or
<em>copied</em>. If you cut or copy another project, before <em>pasting</em> the
previous one, that project will be lost forever.
<P>
On the other hand it is possible to paste a cutted or copied project
multiple times.

<hr>
<A name="s-editmenu-prop"><h4>
2.1.2.2 <code>Properties...</code>
</h4></A>
This function shows the <em>properties dialog</em>, or, if it is allready
shown, updates its contents. See <A href="ch-dialogs.html#s-prop">The Properties Dialog, section 3.2</A> for more details.


<hr>
<A name="s-editmenu-pref"><h4>
2.1.2.3 <code>Preferences...</code>
</h4></A>
This function shows the <em>preferences dialog</em>. See <A href="ch-dialogs.html#s-pref">The Preferences Dialog, section 3.1</A> for
more details.



<hr>
<A name="s-timermenu"><h3>
2.1.3 The <code>Timer</code> Menu
</h3></A>
The <code>Timer</code> menu lets you start and stop the internal timer (see <A href="ch-working.html#s-timer">The Internal Timer, section 4.1</A> and <A href="#s-projstates">The State of a Project, subsection 2.3.2</A>).
<P>
You can start the timer by activating <code>Start</code>. <code>Stop</code> will stop the
timer. And you can toggle the state of the timer with <code>Timer running</code>.


<hr>
<A name="s-helpmenu"><h3>
2.1.4 The <code>Help</code> Menu
</h3></A>
The only menu item in the <code>Help</code> menu is <code>About...</code>. This function
will popup the <em>about dialog</em>. Just press <code>Close</code> to get rid of it...


<hr>
<A name="s-toolbar"><h2>
2.2 The Toolbar
</h2></A>
Each item in the toolbar activates a menu item. So besides the menu
itself and the shotcut (or accelerator key), I described above, you can use
the toolbar items as a third way of executing a given function.
<P>
The initial state of the toolbar shows icons for the following
functions from left to right:

<ul>
<li><em>File</em> - New Project...
  
  <p><li><em>File</em> - Reload Configuration File

  <p><li><em>File</em> - Save Configuration File
  
  <p><li><em>Edit</em> - Cut
  
  <p><li><em>Edit</em> - Copy
  
  <p><li><em>Edit</em> - Paste
  
  <p><li><em>Edit</em> - Properties...
  
  <p><li><em>Timer</em> - Timer Running
  
  <p><li><em>Edit</em> - Preferences...
<p></ul>





<hr>
<A name="s-projlist"><h2>
2.3 The Project List
</h2></A>
<hr>
<A name="s-projwhat"><h3>
2.3.1 What is a Project
</h3></A>
A project consists of the following:

<ul>
<li>Each project has a title, that is displayed in the project list

  <p><li>There is a <em>daily</em> timer, which will be automatically reset on a
  new day, and which you can zero as you please. This is the timer, that
  will be displayed in the project list.

  <p><li>Another timer holds the total time this project has been worked on.

  <p><li>I have included a description of the project. You can use it to
  specify the project some more.
<p></ul>



<hr>
<A name="s-projstates"><h3>
2.3.2 The State of a Project
</h3></A>
Basically a project has just two states. Selected or unselected. You can
only select one project at a time. An unselected project is just that -
unselected. But there are other values that affect the handling of a
selected project.
<P>
E.g. there is the timer (see <A href="ch-working.html#s-timer">The Internal Timer, section 4.1</A>). The time of a selected
project will only be counted, when the timer is running. This gives us a
third state of a project. Here is a list of states and what happens to a
project in each state:

<dl>
<dt>The project is <em>not</em> selected
  <dd>There is no time measuring or other effect.
  
  <p><dt>The project is selected and the timer is running.
  <dd>In that state, the time is measured for the given project. In
  addition there will be a log file entry for that project (if log files are
  enabled - see <A href="ch-dialogs.html#s-logfile">Logfile, subsection 3.1.3</A>), and the shell command is executed (see
  <A href="ch-dialogs.html#s-shellcmd">Shell Commands, subsection 3.1.2</A>).
  
  <p><dt>The project is selected but the timer is stopped.
  <dd>The time will not be measured, and there is no entry in the log
  file. But the shell command has been run and is not beeing canceled.
<p></dl>

<P>
This might be confusing the first time, but you can benefit from this.
E.g. I use the shell command (see <A href="ch-dialogs.html#s-shellcmd">Shell Commands, subsection 3.1.2</A>) to update my
<code>.project</code> file. When I'm not really working on a project (e.g. because
I'm just away to get me a new coffee or something), I can leave the
<code>.project</code> file alone, but don't have to count the time.

<hr>
<A name="s-projwork"><h3>
2.3.3 Working with the Project List
</h3></A>
The project list is displayed in the main area of the main window. It
shows what projects are in the list, and which project currently is
selected. One line reflects one project. The <em>daily</em> time and the title
of the project are displayed.
<P>
You can select a project by clicking on it with the left mouse button.
Pressing the left mouse button again on a selected project deselects it.
This is the way to mark all projects as unselected.
<P>
To get a popup menu for a project, you have to press and hold the right
mouse button on it. If the project wasn't selected, it will now receive the
selection, and the popup menu will be displayed. The popup menu consists of
the menu items of the <code>Edit</code> menu, which deal with projects. Thus it is
just a replacement for selecting a project and then using the <code>Edit</code>
menu.



<hr>
<A name="s-statusbar"><h2>
2.4 The Status Bar
</h2></A>
The status bar displays the currently selected project. It will display
more info in the future, but that's not implemented in the current version
of GTimeTracker.
<P>
The status bar helps to have a better info about the state of a project I
was blabbering about in <A href="#s-projstates">The State of a Project, subsection 2.3.2</A>. You know exactly if there is
currently no selected project, even if the internal timer is running (which
is reflected by the icon in the <em>Start/Stop Timer</em> toolbar item).
