<chapt id="intro">Introduction
<sect id="feedback">Feedback
<p>Well, I'm german and I find it hard to express myself in english. So if
you find some phrases and/or words that I used in a wrong way (and you will
find them :-) ), please send me a mail, to let me correct this. Please send
me notes about typos, too.

<p>And I would like to hear about your opionion on GTimeTracker. Maybe you
want some features to be integrated in GTimeTracker. Or you have discovered
a bug. Or you think, that the user interface needs a change in some way.
Just send me a mail, and I will see, what I can do for you. I want to make
this tool usable and usefull for everyone.



<sect id="whatis">What is GTimeTracker
<p>Basically GTimeTracker is just a tool to measure the time, you let a
given <em/project/ (see <ref id="projwhat">) in a <em/selected/ state (see
<ref id="projstates">). GTimeTracker isn't espacially smart at this. You,
the user, will have to give GTimeTracker hints about what you're currently
wanting to measure or it will not display reasonable values.

<p>But when one has learned to use GTimeTracker effectively, it can be of
great help. For example you can use it to optimize your work. It can show
you, that you are spending to much time on unimportent tasks. Or it can
exactly count the hours you spend on a project, that is payed for by time.
You may discover many other ways, GTimeTracker can work for you.



<sect id="start">First starting GTimeTracker
<p>After first starting GTimeTracker you will be notified, that there is no
readable configuration file in your home directory
(<tt>$HOME/.gtimetrackerrc</tt>). You will be asked, whether or not you want
GTimeTracker to install a new one. This is a safety question, because
something could have happend that made your configuration file unreadable
and maybe you will want to look for it yourself. Writing a new config file
will cause the loss of all your projects and time measurements. If you
started GTimeTracker for the first time, you can just press the <tt/OK/
button.




<chapt id="main">The Main Window
<p>The main window consists of four areas. There is a menu bar (see <ref
id="menubar">), a toolbar (see <ref id="toolbar">), a status bar at the
bottom of the window (see <ref id="statusbar">), and a scrollable area where
all your projects will be displayed (see <ref id="projlist">). When you
start GTimeTracker for the first time, this area will show just one project,
which is titled "empty".

<p>Note that you can customize the look of the main window in the
preferences dialog (see <ref id="pref">), so not all these areas might show
up after you have played around with GTimeTracker a bit. You can allways
enable missing areas in the preferences dialog.


<sect id="menubar">The Menu Bar
<p>The menu bar is located at the top of the window by default. If you
are using a GNOME version of GTimeTracker, you can change the location of
the menu bar in numerouse ways. This customization of the menu bar is
subject of the GNOME global documentation and not covered here.

<p>Nearly all menu items in GTimeTracker have a shortcut (or accelerator
key). Those key sequences are shown behind the name of the function. If for
example you want to activate the function <tt/New Project.../ from the
<tt/File/ menu, you can just hold down the <tt/Control/ key and press the
<tt/N/ key. In the menu this is shown as <tt/Ctl+N/.

<p>The menu bar consists of four menus: <tt/File/, <tt/Edit/, <tt/Timer/ and
<tt/Help/. I will describe these menus in the following sections.



<sect1 id="filemenu">The <tt/File/ Menu
<p>In the <tt/File/ menu you will find the functions dealing with the
configuration file -- <tt>$HOME/.gtimetrackerrc</tt>. In addition
there is a function to quit GTimeTracker. I have also put the <tt/New
Project.../ funtion there. This is mainly because nearly all software has a
<em/new/ function in the <tt/File/ menu and that's the place I would search
for it.



<sect2 id="filemenu-newproj"><tt/New Project.../
<p>This function shows the <em/New Project Dialog/. Have a look at <ref
id="newproj"> for more info.


<sect2 id="filemenu-rc"><tt/Reload/ and <tt/Save Configuration File/
<p>Okay, let's have a look at the functions dealing with the configuration
file. The configuration file holds infos about your preferences (see <ref
id="pref">) and about your list of projects (see <ref id="projlist">). The
functions are <tt/Reload Configuration File/ and <tt/Save Configuration
File/.

<p>The configuration file will be saved every time, GTimeTracker exits. I
have made some effort, to verify that this file will be updated even in case
of program aborts. So there should be no need to save the configuration file
for safety purpose. But you might want to rearrange your projects a bit. You
may want to save the current state of the projects just to make sure you
cannot delete a project by accident.

<p>In case you made some mistakes you can then use the <tt>Reload
Configuration File</tt> function. You will be asked, if you really want to
discard your current set of projects. Just press <tt/OK/, if you really ment
to reload the old configuration file. If you activated this function by
accident, you can press <tt/Cancel/.


<sect2 id="filemenu-quit"><tt/Quit/
<p>This function just quits GTimeTracker. The configuration file with your
current list of projects will automatically be saved.




<sect1 id="editmenu">The <tt/Edit/ Menu
<p>The <tt/Edit/ menu holds all the functions to edit the project list.
In addition there is a menu item to activate the <em/preferences dialog/.


<sect2 id="editmenu-cut"><tt/Cut/, <tt/Copy/ and <tt/Paste/
<p>These functions are usefull to rearrange your project list. You can use
<tt/Cut/ to remove projects from the list. But these cutted projects aren't
discarted right away. You can use <tt/Paste/ to insert a <em/cutted/ or
<em/copied/ project either before the current selected project, or, if no
project is selected, at the bottom of your project list. The <tt/Copy/
function does the same as the <tt/Cut/ function, but will not remove the
project from the list.

<p>Note that there is only room for <em/one/ project to be <em/cutted/ or
<em/copied/. If you cut or copy another project, before <em/pasting/ the
previous one, that project will be lost forever.

<p>On the other hand it is possible to paste a cutted or copied project
multiple times.


<sect2 id="editmenu-prop"><tt/Properties.../
<p>This function shows the <em/properties dialog/, or, if it is allready
shown, updates its contents. See <ref id="prop"> for more details.



<sect2 id="editmenu-pref"><tt/Preferences.../
<p>This function shows the <em/preferences dialog/. See <ref id="pref"> for
more details.




<sect1 id="timermenu">The <tt/Timer/ Menu
<p>The <tt/Timer/ menu lets you start and stop the internal timer (see <ref
id="timer"> and <ref id="projstates">).

<p>You can start the timer by activating <tt/Start/. <tt/Stop/ will stop the
timer. And you can toggle the state of the timer with <tt/Timer running/.



<sect1 id="helpmenu">The <tt/Help/ Menu
<p>The only menu item in the <tt/Help/ menu is <tt/About.../. This function
will popup the <em/about dialog/. Just press <tt/Close/ to get rid of it...



<sect id="toolbar">The Toolbar
<p>Each item in the toolbar activates a menu item. So besides the menu
itself and the shotcut (or accelerator key), I described above, you can use
the toolbar items as a third way of executing a given function.

<p>The initial state of the toolbar shows icons for the following
functions from left to right:

<list>

  <item><em/File/ - New Project...
  
  <item><em/File/ - Reload Configuration File

  <item><em/File/ - Save Configuration File
  
  <item><em/Edit/ - Cut
  
  <item><em/Edit/ - Copy
  
  <item><em/Edit/ - Paste
  
  <item><em/Edit/ - Properties...
  
  <item><em/Timer/ - Timer Running
  
  <item><em/Edit/ - Preferences...

</list>





<sect id="projlist">The Project List
<sect1 id="projwhat">What is a Project
<p>A project consists of the following:

<list>

  <item>Each project has a title, that is displayed in the project list

  <item>There is a <em/daily/ timer, which will be automatically reset on a
  new day, and which you can zero as you please. This is the timer, that
  will be displayed in the project list.

  <item>Another timer holds the total time this project has been worked on.

  <item>I have included a description of the project. You can use it to
  specify the project some more.

</list>



<sect1 id="projstates">The State of a Project
<p>Basically a project has just two states. Selected or unselected. You can
only select one project at a time. An unselected project is just that -
unselected. But there are other values that affect the handling of a
selected project.

<p>E.g. there is the timer (see <ref id="timer">). The time of a selected
project will only be counted, when the timer is running. This gives us a
third state of a project. Here is a list of states and what happens to a
project in each state:

<taglist>

  <tag>The project is <em/not/ selected
  <item>There is no time measuring or other effect.
  
  <tag>The project is selected and the timer is running.
  <item>In that state, the time is measured for the given project. In
  addition there will be a log file entry for that project (if log files are
  enabled - see <ref id="logfile">), and the shell command is executed (see
  <ref id="shellcmd">).
  
  <tag>The project is selected but the timer is stopped.
  <item>The time will not be measured, and there is no entry in the log
  file. But the shell command has been run and is not beeing canceled.

</taglist>

<p>This might be confusing the first time, but you can benefit from this.
E.g. I use the shell command (see <ref id="shellcmd">) to update my
<tt/.project/ file. When I'm not really working on a project (e.g. because
I'm just away to get me a new coffee or something), I can leave the
<tt/.project/ file alone, but don't have to count the time.


<sect1 id="projwork">Working with the Project List
<p>The project list is displayed in the main area of the main window. It
shows what projects are in the list, and which project currently is
selected. One line reflects one project. The <em/daily/ time and the title
of the project are displayed.

<p>You can select a project by clicking on it with the left mouse button.
Pressing the left mouse button again on a selected project deselects it.
This is the way to mark all projects as unselected.

<p>To get a popup menu for a project, you have to press and hold the right
mouse button on it. If the project wasn't selected, it will now receive the
selection, and the popup menu will be displayed. The popup menu consists of
the menu items of the <tt/Edit/ menu, which deal with projects. Thus it is
just a replacement for selecting a project and then using the <tt/Edit/
menu.




<sect id="statusbar">The Status Bar
<p>The status bar displays the currently selected project. It will display
more info in the future, but that's not implemented in the current version
of GTimeTracker.

<p>The status bar helps to have a better info about the state of a project I
was blabbering about in <ref id="projstates">. You know exactly if there is
currently no selected project, even if the internal timer is running (which
is reflected by the icon in the <em>Start/Stop Timer</em> toolbar item).




<chapt id="dialogs">The Dialogs
<sect id="pref">The Preferences Dialog
<sect1 id="display">Display
<p>You can select, what GTimeTracker should display in the main window,
here.

<taglist>

  <tag><tt/Show Seconds/
  <item>You can tell GTimeTracker, if you want the seconds to be displayed
  in the project list. If seconds are shown, the time displayed in the
  project list looks like <tt/00:12:47/ (hours:minutes:seconds). If not, you
  just see <tt/00:12/ (hours:minutes).

  <tag><tt/Show Toolbar Icons/ and <tt/Show Toolbar Texts/
  <item>If you're using a GNOME version of GTimeTracker, you can select how
  the toolbar should look. You can chosse to display icons and/or a text.

  <tag><tt/Show Status Bar/
  <item>Just choose, if you want the status bar to be displayed.
  
</taglist>



<sect1 id="shellcmd">Shell Commands
<p>
<taglist>

  <tag><tt/Switch Project Command/

    <item>This shell command will be executed every time you select a
    project, which was previously unselected. If you use <tt/%s/ in this
    command, GTimeTracker will replace that by the title of the selected
    project. I use the following entry to update my <tt/.project/ file:

    <example>echo '%s' &gt;~/.project</example>

  <tag><tt/No Project Command/
  
    <item>This shell command will be executed every time you deselect a
    project or if you exit GTimeTracker. To complete the example above, I
    use this command:
    
    <example>rm -f ~/.project</example>

</taglist>



<sect1 id="logfile">Logfile
<p>
<taglist>

  <tag><tt/Use Logfile/
  
    <item>You have to enable this, if you want a logfile.
    
  <tag><tt/Filename/
  
    <item>Give a filename for the logfile. GTimeTracker currently does not
    replace <tt/$HOME/ or <tt/~/. You should give the complete path to the
    logfile.
    
  <tag><tt/Timeout in secs/

    <item>This value represents the minimum time a project has to be
    selected, before it will be logged. This is usefull, when you don't want
    any small task to be logged, or when you clicked on the wrong project
    first. Let's say, you just wanted to start working on a letter to your
    friend Joe (so you selected the project <em/Letter to Joe/), but that
    reminds you, that you have to prepare a list of Christmas presents first
    (Joe has asked you to give him some good ideas). So you switch to the
    project <em/X-Mas presents/. You wouldn't want the project <em/Letter to
    Joe/ to be in your logfile, because you didn't really start it yet. I
    would suggest you set this value at least to 10 seconds.

</taglist>

<p>Note that a project will not get logged, before you either quit
GTimeTracker, switch to another project, or deselct that project. So don't
be confused when you look at your logfile and your current project still
isn't listed, even if it is running since two hours.



<sect1 id="ok-apply-cancel"><tt/OK/, <tt/apply/ and <tt/Cancel/
<p>If you are pleased with the values of the dialog, press <tt/OK/ to make
them active and have the dialog go away.

<p>If you want to apply these values just for a given task and plan to
reopen the dialog again, you can press on <tt/Apply/ to activate the values.
But the dialog will remain open.

<p>If you don't want to change to working values, you just press
<tt/Cancel/. That will close the dialog, but will not change the behavier of
GTimeTracker in any way. I recommend using <tt/Cancel/ even if you didn't
change anything.





<sect id="prop">The Properties Dialog
<p>This dialog shows you all values that are internally stored with a
project.

<p>Note that this is the only way to examine the overall time yet.

<taglist>

  <tag><tt/Project Title/
  
    <item>You can change the title of a project here.
    
  <tag><tt/Project Description/
  
    <item>You can give the project a more detailed description if you like.
    Up to now this value will never be used by GTimeTracker
    
  <tag><tt/Project Time today/
  
    <item>This is the <em/daily/ time, you worked on the project today. You
    can edit this time here.
    
  <tag><tt/Project Time ever/
  
    <item>This is the <em/total/ time, you worked on a project. You can edit
    this time here.

</taglist>

<p>See <ref id="ok-apply-cancel"> for the meaning of the buttons at the
bottom of the dialog.




<sect id="newproj">The New Project Dialog
<p>This dialog is fairly small. It just wants to know, how you want to
entitle the new project. Just enter a title of the new project and press
<tt/OK/, if you are satisfied. Or press <tt/Cancel/ if you changed your mind
and don't want GTimeTracker to add a new project.




<chapt id="working">Working with GTimeTracker
<p>I haven't finished this chapter yet. I just include it here to make my
SGML parser happy about the links to the sections here.

<sect id="timer">The Internal Timer
<p>This section isn't finished yet.
