* Big changes afoot:  
  -- XML file format will store both project and journal data
  -- Heirarchical projects now supported.   Tree can be re-arranged 
     via drag-n-drop.
  -- Journal is viewable as html.
  -- Add variety of billing rates

=============================

* Log file entries can be customized. The start of a project uses the string
  defined in `Entry Start' in the preferences dialog. The end of a project
  uses the string in `Entry Stop'. Both strings can include the following
  macros:

  %t - the project's title
  %d - the project's description
  %T - the time ever in H:MM:SS (H = hours, MM = mins, SS = secs)
  %h - the hours spent on the project today
  %H - the hours spent on the project today (two digits)
  %m - the minutes spent on the project today
  %M - the minutes spent on the project today (00-59)
  %s - the seconds spent on the project today
  %S - the seconds spent on the project today (00-59)

  Thus the string `project %t started (%d)' in `Entry Start' would cause the
  following line to be logged:

  Aug 31 00:39:17 project Project's Title started (Project's Description)

  And the string `stopped project %t (%H:%M:%S)' would append the total time
  spent on the project today as in `(8:03:51)' (meaning 8 hours, 3 minutes and
  51 seconds). Alternatively you could specify %m to get 483 minutes (8*60 +
  3).


New since 0.12.0
================

* The configuration file is gnomified.

* The toolbar settings in the help window are part of the
  configuration file.

* The toolbar can be configured now. I found the default toolbar to be
  much to long when using toolbar texts.
  
* non-Gnome support has been kicked.


New since 0.11.0
================

* internationalized GTT and provided a de.po

* added an experimental help window using Gtk-XmHTML.

* rearranged/renames some menu items a bit.

* changes my own distribution to work with automake

* wrote some documentation - HTML and text.

* added the (optional) status bar. It just contains the title of the current
  selected project yet.

* added a popup menu when right-clicking on a project.

* added clear daily counter to the menus.




New since 0.10.0

Shell Command
-------------

In the Preferences dialog you can specify shell commands which get executed
every time you change or disable a project. You can use '%s' as a
replacement for the title of the new project in "Switch Project Command".


Log Files
---------

It is now possible to write log files. You will have to specify the complete
path of the logfile. '~' and environment variables are unsupported up to
now.

The timeout value specifies the time in seconds, that have to pass before a
selected project will get logged. It is a good idea to set this value to a
minimum of 10 seconds. If you clicked on the wrong project the first time
and correct your selection within 10 seconds, the wrong project will not
show up in the log file.
