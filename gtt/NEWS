* The configuration file is gnomified.

* The toolbar settings in the help window are part of the
  configuration file.

  much to long when using toolbar texts.

Shell Command
-------------

In the Preferences dialog you can specify shell commands which get executed
every time you change or disable a project. You can use '%s' as a
replacement for the title of the new project in "Switch Project Command".


Log Files
---------

It is now possible to write log files. You will have to specify the complete
path of the logfile. '~' and environment variables are unsupported up to
now.

The timeout value specifies the time in seconds, that have to pass before a
selected project will get logged. It is a good idea to set this value to a
minimum of 10 seconds. If you clicked on the wrong project the first time
and correct your selection within 10 seconds, the wrong project will not
show up in the log file.
