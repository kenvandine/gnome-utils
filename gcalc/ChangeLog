2002-07-02 John Fleck <jfleck@inkstain.net>

	* new screenshot (help/C/figures/gcalc_window.png)
	fixes #85766

2002-06-18  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* gnome-calc.c: Turn on the use of superscripts for power labels
	from George's previous patch.

2002-06-04  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* gcalc.c: use _UI_SUBTREE instead of _UI_SUBTREE_STOCK since 
	that makes translations actually work. _UI_SUBTREE_STOCK means
	that the string comes from libgnomeui which in this cases it
	doesn't.

2002-05-31  Ross Burton  <ross@burtonini.com>

	* gcalc.c (about_cb): Set the about dialog as a transient for the
	parent window, so that it appears in the correct place. Fixes #83799.

Fri May 31 13:29:24 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnome-calc.c: fix the 'e' button so that it actually works (use
	  clicked and not the button press event).  Prepare so that we can
	  use the superscripts for the power labels which I didn't change
	  since we're in string freeze.  whack the 'store' global EEEK!
	  Use the fact that memory == 0.0 to see if something is set,
	  that's how most calculators do it.

	* sr.c: random fixage.

2002-05-31  Hidetoshi Tajima <hidetoshi.tajima@sun.com>

	* Makefile.am: Updated fix for #83627.

2002-05-31  Hidetoshi Tajima <hidetoshi.tajima@sun.com>

	widget.

2002-05-28  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* gnome-calc.c: Convert display to use GtkTextView instead 
	of GtkLabel. Fixes #65807 although might have some resizing 
	issues.

2002-05-25  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* gnome-calc.c: Add an 'm' button to mark storage. Kinda
	hacked, but kinda works too. Still some size problems
	though. Fixes #70700.

2002-05-25  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* gcalc.c: (about_cb), (main): Add new calculator image.
	* gnome-calculator.desktop.in: Add .desktop.in love.
	* gnome-calc.c: (negate_val): Don't negate 0's. Fixes #82866.

2002-05-11  Andrew Sobala <andrew@sobala.net>

	* Fix EE calculation. Fixes #81315.

2002-05-10  Sasi Kiran Lanka <sasi.kiran@wipro.com>

	* gnome-calc.c: Fixes #75390, Error in Arithmetic operation.
	(eg: 3+= gives 6; 3+=== gives 12; 3+(8+==)= gives 27)

2002-05-10  Sasi Kiran Lanka <sasi.kiran@wipro.com

	* gnome-calc.c: Include unary operators for fix #74363.

2002-05-09  Yogeesh MB <yogeeshappa.mathighatta@wipro.com>

	* gnome-calc.c: Fixes #74363, gets order of operators wrong  
	(eg: 10+-3 = 7 instead of 13 and 20+-+*3 = 60 instead of 23).

2002-05-07 Satyajit Kanungo  <satyajit.kanungo@wipro.com>

	* gnome-calculator.desktop.in: Added DocPath in the 
	desktop.in file. Fixes #80921.

2002-05-07  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* gcalc.c, gnome-calc.c, sr.c: Wow, this code
	has too many eee's. Fixes #37509

2002-05-04 John Fleck <jfleck@inkstain.net>

	* help/C/figures/gcalc_window.png

2002-04-28  Dennis Cranston <dennis_cranston@yahoo.com>

	dialog. Fixes #80109

2002-04-27  Yogeesh MB <yogeeshappa.mathighatta@wipro.com>

	* gnome-calc.c: ugly hack to avoid the resizing when changing
	from DEG to GRAD. Fixes #74089. There is probably a better way
	to solve this.

2002-04-20  Abel Cheung  <maddog@linux.org.hk>

	* gnome-calc.c: Use verbose tooltips for some buttons in gcalc.

2002-04-24 John Fleck <jfleck@inkstain.net>

	occurs don't require the user to clear the calc if an error
	occurs.

2002-03-18 Yogeesh MB <yogeeshappa.mathighatta@wipro.com>
 
        * gcalc.c : Added session Management Patch#75107

2002-03-21  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

2002-03-10  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* gnome-calc.c: abs has bad results on floats ;) Use fabs

Wed Feb 27 10:11:58 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnome-calculator.c: fix #70151 by treating very low numbers
	  like 0 when they're output from sin and cos.  Also do a more
	  precise conversion for deg->rad, rad->deg for some standard
	  values.  This should work portably even though
	  cos(M_PI_2) != 0.0, which seems stupid to me.

	* doc/C/gcalc.sgml:

	  <yogeeshappa.mathighatta@wipro.com> to right align the

	* Makefile.am, sr.[ch], gcalc.c: Added X11R3 xcalc -analog slide
	  rule mode, courtesy Jamie Zawinski <jwz@jwz.org>, (well it's
	  mostly the original xcalc code, so it kind of sucks, needs
	  to be ported to GTK+ and made not to not suck)

Sun Jun 24 18:12:25 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnome-calc.c: Delete does CE/E, generalize INV creation a bit more,

	s/GnomeCalculator/GnomeCalc/g
	s/gnome_calculator_/gnome_calc_/g
	since we don't want to clash with the symbols in libgnomeui
