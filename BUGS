Bugs should be reported to the GNOME bug tracking system under the product
gnome-utils. It is available at:

        http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=gnome-utils
                                                                                                                                                             
In the report please include the following information:

        Operating system, distribution and version
        How to reproduce the bug if possible
        If the bug was a crash, include the exact text that was printed out
        A stacktrace where possible [see below]

How to get a stack trace
------------------------
If the crash is reproducible, it is possible to get a stack trace and
attach it to the bug report. The following steps are used to obtain a
stack trace:

        Run the program in gdb [the GNU debugger] or any other debugger
                ie. gdb gnome-dictionary
        Start the program
                ie. (gdb) run
        Reproduce the crash and the program will exit to the gdb prompt
        Get the back trace
                ie. (gdb) bt

You will need either to compile the program yourself or, if possible,
install the packages containing the debugging symbols for the program
otherwise the stack trace obtained will be useless to the developers;
see this page:

        http://live.gnome.org/GettingTraces

which contains help, tips and other information about getting a valid
and useful stack trace.

Once you have the stack trace attach a file with it included to the bug
report.
