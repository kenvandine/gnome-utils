	* gw.c (load_actions): Fixed incorrect use of
	gnome_config_iterator_next.

	* gw.c: OK, the configurable popup menus now work for me. You can
	define a command with %u (user) and %t (tty) escape sequences,
	then right-click on the user in the list to run the command with
	their username and tty substituted. e.g. "xterm -e write %u %t".

	* gw.c: Added preferences/config for a feature which allows
	commands to be invoked based on the user listing. However,
	no pop up menus yet so you can't actually use the feature, 
	just configure it.
