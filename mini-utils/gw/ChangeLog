2000-04-16  Jacob Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

	* doc/C/gw.sgml: correspond to the new location

2000-03-12  Peter Hawkins  <peterhawkins@ozemail.com.au>

	* gw.c: Stopped about and preferences dialog boxes from being shown
	multiple times at once (Obviously I have a boring life =).

1999-08-28  Matthias Warkus  <mawa@iname.com>

	* gnome-who.png: Added. I know this already exists in another
	form, it's just been scaled by Ben, but for the heck of it, I
	couldn't figure a better way to say "who?" graphically.
	* gw.desktop: Uses it.
	* Makefile.am: Installs it.

1999-07-28  Zbigniew Chyla <chyla@alice.ci.pwr.wroc.pl>

	* gw.c : Mark strings for translations.

1999-05-13  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* gw.c: Patch from Nicola Pero <n.pero@mi.flashnet.it>
	handles weird versions of w more gracefully, and 
	does column widths the right way.

	* Makefile.am: Don't link with GtkXmHTML libs. (don't know what
	was up with that)

1999-04-28  Ettore Perazzoli  <ettore@comm2000.it>

	* gw.desktop: Added Italian translation.

Thu Jan 07 23:57:41 1999  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* gw.c: add settings menu and put preferences into it

Wed Jan 06 23:13:02 1999  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* gw.c: standardize menus (sorta)

1998-12-19  Herbert Valerio Riedel  <hvr@hvrlab.ml.org>

	* gw.c: added few cast-macros

1998-11-23  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gw.c (prepare_app): Fix GtkCList usage.
	(preferences_cb): ditto.

1998-07-01  Nuno Ferreira  <nmrf@rnl.ist.utl.pt>

	* gw.desktop: Added Portuguese translation.

Mon Jun  8 21:43:52 1998  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* gw.c: Use gnome_execute_shell.

Mon Jun  1 00:08:21 1998  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* Makefile.am: Install the .desktop file.

Thu May 28 01:34:32 1998  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* gw.c (list_clicked_cb): Do the right thing if there's nothing on
	the popup menu (i.e. actions_popup == NULL).
	(main): Check for "w" in the path, and if it isn't found pop up 
	a dialog and exit.

Mon May 25 16:21:57 1998  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* gw.c: Return FALSE instead of TRUE from button press event
	handler if the event is not handled.

Thu Apr 30 02:34:45 1998  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* gw.c: Functional "Add Defaults" button in preferences dialog,
	and some cosmetic changes to the preferences dialog. Also
	added ... to some menu items.

1998-04-28  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gw.c (load_actions): Fixed incorrect use of
	gnome_config_iterator_next.

Sun Apr 26 02:31:39 1998  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* gw.c: OK, the configurable popup menus now work for me. You can
	define a command with %u (user) and %t (tty) escape sequences,
	then right-click on the user in the list to run the command with
	their username and tty substituted. e.g. "xterm -e write %u %t".

Sat Apr 25 17:51:43 1998  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* gw.c: Added preferences/config for a feature which allows
	commands to be invoked based on the user listing. However,
	no pop up menus yet so you can't actually use the feature, 
	just configure it.
