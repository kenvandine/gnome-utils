	Before you begin:

	The Red-Hat patch has only been tested to compile on my Debian
	box.  Sorry.

	The CORBA server code needs a little more conversion work.

	THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT VERSION OF THE SOFTWARE.	DO NOT USE
	WITHOUT AUDITING YOUR IMPLEMENTATION.


	How it works:

	This package doesn't build the suid code right now.  That takes a
	custom patch to your local su.c (or sudo with a little more work).

	gsu_call_suid (in gsu-gui-api.c) forks and execs gsu-suid (some
	su patched to use gsu-suid-api.c).  The calling convention
	for gsu-suid should be the same as su (-c command username).
	A message and password pipe are set up to gsu-suid so that the
	password can be read, and if anything is written to the message
	pipe it winds up in an error dialog that the user has to confirm.
	Read the gsu-*-api.[hc] files, they are short and sweet.

	libglade interface written.

	Check the ChangeLog for a list of revisions.

	This utility is included in the GNOME 1.0 release, but it has
	not yet been security audited and the GUI is not yet written.

	It won't get build by default.
