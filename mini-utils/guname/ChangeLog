1999-07-21  Nat Friedman  <nat@gnome-support.com>

	* guname.c: If capplet support is enabled, include
 	guname-capplet.h and support the --capplet argument.
	(main): Check for the --capplet argument.  Use
 	gnome_capplet_init if it is specified.
	(create_guname_capplet_window): New function.

	* Makefile.am: Link with -lcapplet and -lgnorba and install
 	guname-capplet.desktop if guname capplet support is enabled.

1999-05-11  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* info.c (get_portable_info): Implement suggestion from
	Nicola Pero <n.pero@mi.flashnet.it>, use g_get_user_name()
	and gdk_get_display().

1999-04-28  Ettore Perazzoli  <ettore@comm2000.it>

	* guname.desktop: Added Italian translations.

1999-04-20  Matthias Warkus  <mawa@iname.com>

	* info.c: recognises and stats SuSE distros now

Fri Mar 12 11:24:41 1999  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* moreinfo.c: added a scrolled widget for the memory information

1999-02-25  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* guname.c (marquee_timer): Speed up the scrolling - too many
	people!
	(scroll_text_widths[]): Fix this array to be the right size,
	repairs bug noted by Dr. Mike.

1999-02-24  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* Makefile.am (build_AUTHORS): Removed this target.

	* build-authors.pl: This will refuse to run unless you read
	the comment in it.

	* AUTHORS.H: Removed some people that were listed twice due to a
	different spelling of their names in different AUTHORS files.

1999-02-24  Nat Friedman  <nat@nat.org>

	* AUTHORS.h: Updated this.  I didn't use build-authors.pl, since
 	it ignores a lot of people; I just did it by hand, and I sorted it
 	properly (use sort -u +3 +2 +1).  I had to hand-edit the file a
 	fair bit since the AUTHORS files really have no standard format.

1999-02-23  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* AUTHORS.h: Recreated this file with my `build-authors.pl'.

1999-02-02  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* Makefile.am: Put moreinfo.[ch] in EXTRA_DIST.

1999-01-18  Christopher Blizzard  <blizzard@appliedtheory.com>

	* guname.c (mail_callback): Change depreciated
 	gnome_request_string_dialog() to gnome_request_dialog().

	* list.c (create_clist): Comment out gtk_clist_set_border().  This
 	has been removed from gtk.

	* guname.c (do_list_box): Comment out gtk_clist_set_border().
  	This has been removed from gtk.

1998-12-24  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* moreinfo.c (fill_disk_page): Cosmetic updates. Don't use a
	GtkFrame but a viewport with an etched in shadow. Never use a
	horizontal scrollbar.
	(fill_cpuinfo_page): Use a scrolled window here.

1998-12-24  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* build-authors.pl: Perl script to create the AUTHORS.h file.
	Reads the CVSROOT/modules file to get everything that's in the
	`gnome' CVS alias and fetches the AUTHORS file of all those
	modules from CVS before creating the list.

	Invoke this script with the name of a temp directory and pipe
	its output through `sort -u' to create the AUTHORS.h file.

	* AUTHORS.h: Recreated using my new build-authors.pl script and
	edited a little bit by hand.

	* guname.c: Small fix to allow more than 100 entires in the
	authors list.

1998-12-18  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* moreinfo.c (fill_disk_page): add_with_viewport to scrolled
	window, matching newest Gtk. Patch from Daniel Burrows
	<Daniel_Burrows@brown.edu>
	
1998-12-14  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* guname.c (do_logo_box): Use gtk_widget_set_usize() instead of
	gnome_canvas_set_size().

1998-12-01  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* Makefile.am (AUTHORS.h): Add to BUILT_SOURCES.

1998-11-25  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* guname.c (do_list_box): Add the scrolled window to the main
	window, not the clist.

1998-11-25  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* AUTHORS.h: Take it out of CVS.

1998-11-23  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* list.c (create_clist): Fix GtkCList usage.

1998-11-05  Jonathan Blandford  <jrb@aware-of-vacuity.labs.redhat.com>

	* AUTHORS.h: Now my name is spelled correctly.

1998-10-14  Nuno Ferreira  <nmrf@rnl.ist.utl.pt>

	* info.c: included <config.h>

1998-09-12  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* list.c (fill_clist_from_libgtop_entry): New function. Only
	defined if we `HAVE_LIBGTOP_SYSINFO'.

	* moreinfo.c: Display CPU Information if we `HAVE_LIBGTOP_SYSINFO'.
	This is basically everything Linux has in /proc/cpuinfo, but it
	uses LibGTop to be protable.

	* info.c (get_linux_info): Added code to get RedHat release.

1998-09-07  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* guname.c: Added buttons to the main dialog. (for now in addition
	to the popup menu, but really the popup menu can go away.) Added
	confirmation dialog to the mail function, which shows you the
	information about to be sent and asks if it's OK.
	
	* info.c (load_system_info): If the function is called a second
	time, clear the array and refill it. This makes it easier to add
	"refresh" to guname. But it's still annoying to implement in
	moreinfo.c and I'm too lazy to do it now. Also #if 0'd some old
	cruft.

	* moreinfo.h: fix a comment.

1998-09-06  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* guname.c (do_logo_box): Use the big logo, not the little
	icon. Compile with gratuitous sparkles if WITH_SPARKLES is
	specified.

1998-08-23  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* fsusage.c, fsusage.h, mountlist.c, mountlist.h: Removed.
	* moreinfo.c: We now use libgtop for the mountlist and fsusage
	stuff.

1998-08-21  Jens Lautenbacher  <jens@tellux.de>

	* guname.c (do_logo_box): Fixed font size to make it more likely
 	to have a nice unscaled bitmapped font.

1998-08-18  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* Makefile.am (guname_LDADD): Added LIBGTOP_EXTRA_LIBS.

1998-08-05  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* Makefile.am (guname_LDADD): This program needs
	LIBGTOP_NAMES_LIBS, not just LIBGTOP_LIBS.

1998-07-01  Nuno Ferreira  <nmrf@rnl.ist.utl.pt>

	* guname.desktop: Added Portuguese translation.

Mon Jun  8 21:44:52 1998  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* guname.c (file_selection_cb): Check error code on fclose() when
 	saving, and add NULL as last arg of g_copy_strings.

1998-06-05  Martin Baulig  <baulig@merkur.uni-trierd.e>

        * moreinfo.c (fill_mem_page): Bug fix - Memory size is in kilobytes
        not in megabytes.

Wed Jun  3 17:29:07 1998  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* moreinfo.c: Build correctly if HAVE_LIBGTOP is undefined.

1998-06-03  Martin Baulig  <baulig@merkur.uni-trier.de>

	* Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Added $(LIBGTOP_INCS).

Mon Jun  1 00:10:31 1998  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* Makefile.am: Install .desktop file

Wed May 27 23:05:41 1998  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* moreinfo.c: Whoops, I was using the same number for percent full
 	on all filesystems. Change to a list of percentages. Real silly
 	there... I'm tired...

Wed May 27 01:26:11 1998  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* moreinfo.c: Added memory information checks using libgtop, ifdef
 	HAVE_LIBGTOP. Replaced silly struct/array with a plain array and
 	global variables. Duh.	
	* list.c: Check for NULL in both arrays before filling in row.
	* moreinfo.h: Memory stuff.
	* Makefile.am: added libgtop to libraries.

Tue May 26 00:50:26 1998  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* Makefile.am: Add new files.
	* guname.c: Add new menu item for "Detailed Information"
	* info.h: Took out disks stuff, replaced by moreinfo.h
	* moreinfo.h, moreinfo.c: Added code to get information on
	each mounted device and display it.

Mon May 25 16:20:23 1998  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* guname.c: Moved lots of functionality out into separate files
	in preparation for adding "Detailed information" dialog and 
	libgtop stuff.
	* Makefile.am: Add new files.

Mon May 18 17:14:44 1998  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* guname.c: Pasted in marquee thingy from Gimp about dialog. I
	might take it out again; is it cool, or annoying? 
	Declared globals static.
	(popup_main_dialog): Connect to "close" not "clicked" for quit.
	Use GTK_WIN_POS_CENTER for window.
	(do_logo_box): Display the marquee, and use a larger font for
	title.

Mon May 18 14:45:47 1998  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* guname.c: Added Mail To and Save As features. Use gnome foot as
	temporary logo, so everything is ready to go as soon as there's a
	real logo.

Thu Apr 30 02:48:00 1998  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* guname.c: Took out an out-of-date comment. Added .desktop.
