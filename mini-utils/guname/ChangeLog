	* guname.c: Pasted in marquee thingy from Gimp about dialog. I
	might take it out again; is it cool, or annoying? 
	Declared globals static.
	(popup_main_dialog): Connect to "close" not "clicked" for quit.
	Use GTK_WIN_POS_CENTER for window.
	(do_logo_box): Display the marquee, and use a larger font for
	title.

	* guname.c: Added Mail To and Save As features. Use gnome foot as
	temporary logo, so everything is ready to go as soon as there's a
	real logo.
