 <para> This is the Gnome shutdown window.  If you want to turn your
      computer off, choose "Shut Down" rather than "Reboot," then
      press "OK." Wait a few moments for your computer to prepare
      itself, then turn it off. If you see the line "System Halted,"
      it's safe to power down the system.  If your computer has
      Advanced Power Management support, like many laptops and some
      desktops, you may not need the power button.</para>

      <para> To reboot, just choose "Reboot," press "OK," and wait.</para>

      <para> There is also a preferences dialog which allows you to
      configure the shutdown command line. For details of runlevels
      and the effect of various command line shutdown instructions,
      see your computer's documentation. If you are unfamiliar with
      the details of these issues, you
      should stick to the Easy tab. If you do know these things, the
      Advanced tab should be self-explanatory.</para>
