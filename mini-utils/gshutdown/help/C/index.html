      <h1>Shutting Down</h1>

      <h2> How to shut down or reboot the system</h2>

      <p> This is the Gnome shutdown window.  If you want to turn your
      computer off, choose "Shut Down" rather than "Reboot," then
      press "OK." Wait a few moments for your computer to prepare
      itself, then turn it off. If you see the line "System Halted,"
      it's safe to power down the system.  If your computer has
      Advanced Power Management support, like many laptops and some
      desktops, you may not need the power button.

      <p> To reboot, just choose "Reboot," press "OK," and wait.

      <h2> Advanced features </h2>
	
      <p> Using the Advanced tab, you can change to any
      runlevel. There is also a preferences dialog which allows you to
      configure the shutdown command line. If you don't know what a
      runlevel is, or how to shut down from the command line, you
      should stick to the Easy tab. If you do know these things, the
      Advanced tab should be self-explanatory.
