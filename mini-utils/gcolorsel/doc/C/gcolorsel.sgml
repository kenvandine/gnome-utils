  <para>
   &gcolor; is a utility for selecting screen (i.e., X Window System)
   color. X Window System comes with many pre-defined colors, from
   Alice Blue to Pale Goldenrod to Yellow Green. &gcolor; lets you
   browse these colors and select one of them to use by an
   application. It also allows you define your own collection of
   favorite colors, or find a pre-defined color most closely matching
   a given one.

   <guimenuitem>Color Browser</guimenuitem> from the
   <guisubmenu>Utilities</guisubmenu> submenu of the <guimenu>Main
   Menu</guimenu>, or type <command>gcolorsel</command> on the
   command line. 
  </para>

   &gcolor; is included in the
   <filename>gnome-utils</filename> package, which is part of the
   GNOME desktop environment. This document describes version
   &version; of &gcolor;.

 <!-- ================ Usage ================================ -->
 <!-- This section should describe basic usage of the application. -->

  <sect1 id="usage">
    <title>Using GNOME Color Browser</title>
    <para>
    &gcolor; is used for selecting a screen color to be used by an
    application. Unlike the default color selector used by GNOME
    applications, the primary goal of &gcolor; is to let you choose
    one of a list of already defined colors, hence the name "color
    browser". It allows you to browse the list of all pre-defined
    system colors (see <xref linkend="simple">), or define your own
    "favorite" colors (see <xref linkend="favorites">). It can also
    show you those colors from these lists which most closely match a
    given one (see <xref linkend="search">). 
   </para> 
   

    <para> Once you have found a color you like, there are two ways
      you can use this color in an application. The easiest way is to
      utilize drag and drop: all the color bars you see in the
      &gcolor; window can be drag-and-dropped onto any GNOME component
      which has configurable colors. For example, you can drag a color
      onto GNOME <interface>Panel</interface> to change Panel's
      background color, or onto GNOME Terminal to change its
      background.
   </para>
   <para> You can also use the color with many X Window applications
    which are not GNOME-compliant, for example with
    <application>emacs</application> text editor. Most of X
    applications accept command line options <command>-bg
    <replaceable>COLOR</replaceable></command> and  <command>-fg
    <replaceable>COLOR</replaceable></command> to specify the
    background and foreground color. <replaceable>COLOR</replaceable>
    can be either color name, as shown by &gcolor; or its description
    by a triple of numbers, Red, Green, and Blue (RGB).  For example,
    the command 
<programlisting>
<command>emacs -bg lightblue -fg darkgreen</command>
</programlisting>
     will start <application>emacs</application> with light blue
     background and dark green foreground. Note that contrary to
     common UNIX conventions, color names are
     case-insensitive.
     More information about colors in X Window System, color depth,
     RGB values, is given in <xref linkend="xcolors">. 
    </para>
    <para>Note that &gcolor; only allows you to select one of the
    colors known to it (system colors or favorites); you can not
    use it to "create" new colors. For example, it does not allow you
    to select a color by entering its Red, Green and Blue (RGB)
    values. However, it does give you a list of known colors most
    closely matching given RGB values (see <xref linkend="search"> for
    details). 
     </para> 


  <sect2 id="menubar">
   <title>Menus</title>
   <para>
    The menu bar, located at the top of the &gcolor; window, contains
    the following menus:

           each color (see details in <xref linkend="xcolors">). Unless
           you know what you are doing, it is best to use the default

         The toolbar contains three buttons:

  <sect1 id="simple">
   <title>Simple browsing</title>
    <para> 
      This window, labelled <guilabel>Simple</guilabel>, shows you all
    pre-defined named  system colors, as shown in <xref
    linkend="simplefig">. For each color, it shows a small sample,
    Red, Green and Blue (RGB) values, and color name.  
    These colors can not be changed by the user (for advanced users,
    we note that these colors are defined in a special configuration
    file, <filename>rgb.txt</filename>, located in X11 library
    directory, usually <filename
    class="directory">/usr/lib/X11R6/lib/X11</filename>).

    <para>As was mentioned before, you can drag any of the color
      rectangles to GNOME Panel, GNOME Terminal, and many other GNOME
      applications windows to change their background colors. 
    </para>
    <para> 
      By default, the colors are listed alphabetically by name, which is
      indicated by a small downward triangle next to the label
      <guilabel>Name</guilabel>.  As with
      all GNOME applications, you can reverse the order by clicking on
      the word <guilabel>Name</guilabel> once. You can also have the list
      ordered by the RGB values, by clicking on 
      <guilabel>Value</guilabel>,  though it seems to be of little use. 
    </para> 
    <para> 
      You can change the default width of <guilabel>Color</guilabel>,
      <guilabel>Search</guilabel> and <guilabel>Name</guilabel> fields by
      dragging the separator between these fileds with the left mouse
      button. 
    </para>
  </sect1> 

  <sect1 id="search">
    <title> Search</title> 
    <para>This window, labelled <guilabel>Search</guilabel>, is used
    to find a system color most closely matching a given one. You can
    specify a color to match in several ways: by explicitly giving
    the RGB values using the sliders, by dragging and dropping a color
    from some other color source, such as default GNOME color
    selector (if you have selected the option 
     <menuchoice><guisubmenu>On drop</guisubmenu> 
       <guimenuitem>Search</guimenuitem>
   </menuchoice> in <guimenu>Settings</guimenu> menu), or by grabbing
    a color of any pixel on the screen. To use this last method, click
    on <guibutton>Grab</guibutton> button in the toolbar. Your mouse
    cursor will turn into a "crosshair". Place this crosshair
    over any point of the screen and click. &gcolor; will analyze the
    color of this point, determine the RGB values, and show this color
    and the RGB values in the <guilabel>Search</guilabel> window. It
    will also show all system colors closely matching this one. 
    </para>


    <figure id="searchfig">
     <title>Search Window</title>
     <screenshot>
      <screeninfo>Color Browser Search Window</screeninfo>
      <graphic fileref="search" format="png"
       srccredit="sasha">
      </graphic>
     </screenshot>
    </figure>

    <para> 
      &gcolor; shows only those colors which match the given one
      "close enough", and orders them by how close they are, so that
      the best matches are shown first. You can adjust its tolerance
      by using the <guilabel>Tolerance</guilabel> slider: smaller
      values make &gcolor; to be more selective, so that only very close
      matches are shown. Setting the tolerance value to 0 will show
      only exact matches; setting tolerance to 100 will show all the
      colors. 
    </para> 
    <para> 
      By default, &gcolor; only looks for matches among the system
      ("simple") colors. This can be changed using <guimenuitem>Search
      in...</guimenuitem> item in the <guimenu>Settings
      menu</guimenu>, which allows you to enable or disable searches
      in "simple"(system) and "favorites" (personal) colors
      independently. 
    </para>
    <para>Another configurable option is the update mode. By default,
    &gcolor; continuously 
    updates matches when you change the color (for example, by using
    the RGB sliders) &mdash;. If you find that this is slow on your
    sytem, you can use <menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu>
     <guimenuitem>Search update</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice> to change the update mode to
    <guilabel>Discontinuous</guilabel> (&gcolor; will only update
    matches after you released the slider) or
    <guilabel>Delayed</guilabel> ((&gcolor; will  update
    matches with a delay of about 1/2 second). 
    </para>




  </sect1>



  <sect1 id="favorites">
    <title> Favorites</title> 

   <para>In addition to system colors, which are defined in a
    system-wide configuration file and are shown in <link
    linkend="simple">Simple browsing</link> window, &gcolor; also
    allows you to define your personal favorite colors. You can browse
    these colors in <guilabel>Favorites</guilabel> window, shown in
    <xref linkend="favoritesfig">. You can use these colors in the same
    way as system-wide colors, by dragging them to a GNOME application
    such as GNOME Panel or GNOME Terminal to change background color.
    </para>

    <figure id="favoritesfig">
     <title>Favorites Window</title>

       srccredit="sasha">
      </graphic>
     </screenshot>
    </figure>
    <para> You can add a color to the list of favorites in several
    ways. First, you can click with the right mouse button on any of
    the system colors in <guilabel>Simple</guilabel> or
    <guilabel>Search</guilabel> windows and select
    <guimenuitem>Add to favorites</guimenuitem> from the
    <guimenu>pop-up</guimenu> menu. Second,you can use drag and drop: if
    you have selected  the option 
    <menuchoice><guisubmenu>On drop</guisubmenu> 
       <guimenuitem>Add to favorites</guimenuitem>
   </menuchoice>
   in <guimenu>Settings</guimenu> menu, then dragging a color from a
    GNOME color source, such as the default GNOME color selector onto
    the &gcolor; window automatically adds this color to the list of
    favorites.  Finally, you can also explicitly specify the RGB
    values for a color in the <guilabel>Search</guilabel> window, then
    right-click on the rectangle showing this color (to the right of
    RGB sliders) and select <guimenuitem>Add to
    favorites</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>pop-up</guimenu>
    menu. In the same way, you can also add a color which you grabbed
    from the screen using <guibutton>Grab</guibutton> button in the
    toolbar. 
   </para>
   <para> Right-clicking on any color in the
   <guilabel>Favorites</guilabel> window produces a
   <guimenu>pop-up</guimenu> menu, which allows you to rename or
   remove a color.
    </para>
   </sect1>
  
  <sect1 id="xcolors">
    <title>Colors in X Window System</title> 

    <para> In X Window system, each color is described by 3 numbers,
      namely the contents of Red, Green and Blue (as is well known,
      every color can be obtained by combining these three primary
      colors). These 3 values are commonly called the RGB
      values. Usually each of them is allowed to range from 0 to 255;
      for example, triple (0,0,0) is black, (255,0,0) is pure red, and
      (255, 255, 255) is white.  
      </para> 
      <para> The total number of possible colors is thus
      256&times;256&times;256=2<superscript>24</superscript>=16,777,216.
      Of course, whether or not your system is actually able to show
      that many different colors depends on the configuration of X
      Window system, which is limited by the capabilities of your
      video card. Most modern video cards are capable of showing all
      these colors; some older cards will only be able to use
      2<superscript>16</superscript>=64,536 (colordepth 16) or even
      2<superscript>8</superscript>=256 (colordepth 8) colors. In this
      case, X Window System will still use triples like (234, 112,
      243) for describing RGB values, but some of these triples will
      produce identical colors. More information about colors can be
      found in the manual page for X.
