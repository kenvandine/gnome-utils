(UPDATE ON 2000-04-24)

Liable to change :

[ ] When closing a view, close the document ?

Next works :

[X] Save / Save as / Save fail dialogs
[X] Show a warning if session can load a file
[ ] Split virtual.
[ ] Create new document dialog.

[ ] After that, I will have a lot of annoying works for school :-(
[ ] Examination

[ ] New color

+ Properties :

[X] * ColorList : width - height - show number
[X] + All : show / hide control.
[ ] + ColorGrid : Order by (?)
[X] + Show info on a document (file loaded ...).

* Misc :

[X] + Save session on exit
[X] + Intl

* File :

[ ] + Create document (With druid ?)
[X] + Display a warning when closing a window (when we have more than 2 windows)
      "Closing this windows will destroy xx views, etc ..."
[X] + Create view
[X] + Save / Save as
[ ] + Last version
[X] + Close document
[ ] + A dialog with a list of documents to close. Since all document 
      didn't have at least 1 view, user need that to close a document !

+ Edit :

[X] + Edit color
[ ] + New color (Create a new color + switch to a new mdi-edit-view)
[ ] + Grab a color (? and after ...)
[ ] + Put selected colors in ...
[ ] + Search selected colors in ...
[ ] + Add/Search preview colors in ...

+ ColorGrid : 

[ ] * Scroll when drag / key.
[ ] + Cancel drag
[ ] + Change item border if color is black ... (?)
[X] + Popup menu

+ ViewColorEdit :

[ ] + DnD for preview
[ ] * Maybe sort color in GtkList. (order by pos / name)

+ For gimp palette : 

[ ] * Load signature
[ ] * Save signature
[X] * Create a control that modify signature (properties in mdi-color-file).

+ Progress bar :

[X] + When loading
[ ] + When saving
[ ] + Perhaps : in operation ???

+ Misc :

[ ] + Print (?)
[ ] + Bonobo (???)

[X] + Icon bar.

[X] + Don't use GnomeMDI to display EDIT menu. (since all the view have the 
      same menu)

+ Virtual document :

[ ] + Split; make mdi-color-virtual base class for :

      + mdi-color-virtual-search-rgb
      + mdi-color-virtual-search-name

[ ] + And, maybe a virtual view constructed from selected colors, viewed
      by a view-color-edit ... so, the only colors you get in the combo's view
      will be the selected colors ...
      (? how to save it for session ?).

+ Speed :

[X] What is optimizated : 

	mdi-color-generic.c		
	mdi-color-virtual.c
		
	view-color-grid.c             
	view-color-list.c		

  TODO : view-color-edit.c

[ ] Bugs fix / tests
[ ] Help (someone is writting it)
