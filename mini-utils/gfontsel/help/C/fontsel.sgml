      <title> Introduction</>
      <para>
	GNOME font selector dialog is a simple utility for choosing a screen
	(i.e. X Window system) font. It is usually launched when you
	are changing an application's font in a "Settings" or
	"Preferences" dialog. It can also be launched from the main
	menu by selecting <guimenuitem>Font Selector</> item in the
	<guimenu>Utitlities</> submenu of the <guimenu>Main Menu</>,
	or from the command line by running command
	<command>gfontsel</>. 
      </para>
      <para> It is important to know that in X Window system, each
	font has a number of attributes, such as family (Helvetica,
	Times, Courier&hellip;), size, weight, slant, etc., and two fonts
	are considered different even if they only differ in one of
	the properties, such as size or weight: Helvetica 10 point,
	Helvetica 12 point and Helvetica 10 point bold are considered
	to be different fonts.  Each font has a unique name
	(officially known as X Logical Font Description, or XLFD),
	which includes the values of all font's attributes, and by
	necessity is very long. Detailed description of X Window
	fonts, their attributes and names can be found in 
       <xref linkend="XLFD">.
      </para>
    </sect1>
    <sect1 id="mainwin">
      <title>Main window</>
      <para>  
	This window (labelled <guilabel>Font</>) is the main window
	used for choosing the font.
	</para>
      <sect2 id="mainwin-basic">
	<title>Basic usage</>
       <para>
	To choose a font, select the font family
	(for example, <guilabel>courier</>) in the left
	column, then select font style&mdash;that is, weight and slant (for
	example, <guilabel>bold italic</>), and finally, font size. 
      </para>
      <para>   
	The
	<guilabel>Preview</> window will show you how the selected font looks
	like. By default, it shows the Latin alphabet; you can also
	type any text you like in this window, and it will be shown
	using the selected font. 
      </para>
      <para>
	To find more information about the selected font, you can switch to
	the window labelled <link linkend="fontinfo"><guilabel>Font
	information</></link>. 
      </para> 
      <para>
	If the font selector utility was launched by some application, such as
	one of the preferences dialogs, you will have buttons
	<guibutton>OK</> and <guibutton>Cancel</> at the bottom of
	the window. After you are
	satisfied with the chosen font, you can press <guibutton>OK</> and the
	name of the selected font will be returned to the launching
	application. 
      </para>
      <para>
	If the font selector utility was started from the menu or from the
	command line, it will have buttons <guibutton>Apply</> and
	<guibutton>Close</>.  Pressing <guibutton>Apply</> button will copy
	the full name (XLFD) of the selected font to the clipboard, so that it
	can be pasted into any other area of the screen by pressing the middle
	mouse button. Pressing <guibutton>Apply</> button also shows the name
	of the selected font in the <guilabel>Selection</> field at the top of
	the screen. 
      </para>
	</sect2>
      <sect2 id="mainwin-fine">
       <title> Finer points</>
      <para> If there are several fonts with the same family name, the
	font foundry (usually the vendor name) will also be shown in
	the left field, for example: <guilabel>courier(adobe)</>,
	<guilabel>courier(bitstream)</>.
      </para>
      <para>
	<guilabel>Font Style</> field shows more than just font weight
	and slant. Namely, it also shows font's spacing, which can be
	monospaced (<guilabel>[M]</>), character-cell
	(<guilabel>[C]</>), or proportional (no label). In monospaced
	and character-cell fonts, each character has the same width;
	in proportional fonts, the character width varies, which
	usually looks better. 
         <warning> 
         <title>Warning</>
	  <para> Unfortunately, terminal emulation
	programs (including <application>xterm</> and
	<application>gnome-terminal</>) and many programs initially
	designed to work in a terminal (such as <application> emacs</>
	editor) can only properly display monospaced and character
	cell fonts.
       </para>
       </warning> 
      </para>
      <para>
	Finally, <guilabel>Font Style</> field also shows all possible
	character sets available for given font (if there is more than
	one). Roughly speaking, character set describes symbols of
	what alphabet are shown in this font. The most common charset
	is iso8859-1, which includes all Latin letters, punctuation
	marks, numbers and enough accented letters to cover majority
	of Western European languages. More information is given in
	<xref linkend="XLFD">.
      </para>

      <para> You will also notice that in the <guilabel>Size</> field,
        some font sizes are marked with stars. These are the sizes of
        unscaled bitmap fonts; they usually look better than other
        type (scalable and scaled bitmap) fonts&mdash;see <xref
        linkend="filter">.  
      </para> 
      
      <para> You can configure the font
        selector dialog to show only those fonts which meet certain
        criteria. This is done in the <link
        linkend="filter"><guilabel>Filter</> window</link>. If you
        later decide that you again want to see all the fonts, just
        press the button <guibutton>Reset Filter</> either in the main
        window or in the filter window.
      </para>


      </sect2>	
    </sect1>
    <sect1 id="fontinfo">
      <title>Font Information window</>
      <para>
	This window shows the information about selected font, both the
	values you requested and actual values. This is useful if you want to
	check the values of some of the font's parameters which you can not
	specify in the main window, such as screen resolution. This window
	also shows the full font name (XLFD - <xref linkend="XLFD">), which 
	contains the same information.
      </para>
    </sect1>


    <sect1 id="filter">
      <title>Filter window</>
      <para>
	In this window, you can set the font selector to show only the
	fonts which satisfy some criteria.  You can specify values for
	font foundry (vendor), weight, character set, slant, set
	width, and spacing. You can choose * which means "any value";
	you can also specify several values for the same field: just
	click on several of the them with the left mouse button (you
	do not need to hold <keycap>SHIFT</> or <keycap>CTRL</>).
      </para>
      <para> You can also specify allowed font types, using
	checkbuttons at the top of this window. Possible types are
	bitmap fonts, scalable fonts, and scaled bitmaps. The most
	common fonts are bitmap fonts; scalable fonts (TrueType and
	Type 1 PostScript) usually produce equally good quality, but
	not all implementations of X Window system are able to use
	them.
      </para>
      <para> 
	As the name shows, scalable fonts can be scaled to any size without
	loss of quality. While it is possible to scale bitmap fonts as well,
	the quality of scaled bitmap fonts is disastrous. For this reason, by
	default font selector does not show scaled bitmap fonts. 
      </para>
      <para>
	After you have set your filter, you can return to the <link
	linkend="mainwin">main window</>  
	(do not press <guibutton>OK</> or <guibutton>Apply</> - just choose
	the tab <guilabel>Font</>), which will now only show the fonts
	satisfying your criteria. To remind you about this, the main window
	will now show words "Filter applied".
      </para>
      <para>
	To return to the default filter (i.e., show all possible fonts except
	for scaled bitmaps), press <guibutton>Reset Filter</> either in the
	Filter window or in the main window.
      </para>
    </sect1>
    <sect1 id="XLFD">
      <title> Font attributes in X Window system and XLFD</>
      <para>
	As was said earlier, each font in X Window system has a number
	of attributes and a full name, also known as X Logical Font
	Description (XLFD), which lists all of these attributes and therefore
	is quite long.  Typical font name looks like this
	<programlisting>
	  -adobe-courier-medium-r-normal--12-120-75-75-m-70-iso8859-1
	</>
      </para>
      <para>
	This name consists of 14 fields, showing the values of 14 parameters
	of the font, separated by dashes. 
      </para>
      <para>
	While such a  name gives a complete information about the font, it is
	somewhat overwhelming, especially since not all of this parameters are
	actually useful. To make life a little bit easier, you can use
	wildcard * in the font name; for example, the previous font can also
	be referred to as 
	<programlisting>
	  -adobe-courier-medium-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
	</>
	As usual, * matches any value; if there are several fonts matching the
	given name, the system will pick the first matching one. In this
	particular example, most probably there is only one font matching this
	name, so this name is unambiguous. 
      </para>
      <para> 
	Below we list those of the  font's 14 attributes which are actually
	useful:
	<itemizedlist mark=bullet>
	  <listitem><para> <guilabel>foundry</> - font foundry, the company or
	      individual which made the font (in our example, adobe)
	    </para></listitem>

	  <listitem><para>
	      <guilabel>family</> - font family, the popular nickname
	      of the font (in our example, courier) 
	    </para></listitem>

	  <listitem><para> 
              <guilabel>weight</> - font weight (in our
	      example, medium). Admissible values: bold, medium, etc.
	      </para></listitem>

	  <listitem><para> 
              <guilabel>slant</> - font slant (in our example,
	      (r)oman, i.e. unslanted). Admissible values: (i)talics,
	      (o)blique, (r)roman, etc.  
	    </para></listitem>

	  <listitem><para> 
              <guilabel>pixelsize</> - the number of pixels vertically
	      in a character (in our example, 12) 
	    </para></listitem>

	  <listitem><para> 
              <guilabel>pointsize</> - approximate point size of the
	      text, measured in tenths of a point. In the example
	      above, point size is 120, that is, 12 points. One point
              is equal to  1/72.72 of an
	      inch, which is the common convention in English and
              American typesetting. 
	    </para></listitem>

	  <listitem><para> 
               horizontal and vertical
	      <guilabel>resolutions</> in dots per inch - in the
	      example above, both are 75 dpi.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      Note that point size, pixel size, and vertical resolution are
	      related: for fonts with resolution 75dpi, point size is
	      approximately equal to (pixel size)*10; for fonts with resolution
	      100dpi, point size is approximately equal to (pixel size)*7.
	    </para></listitem>

	  <listitem><para> <guilabel>spacing</> - describes variance
              of character sizes in the font. Allowed values are
              (m)onospaced, (c)haracter cell (in both of these
              spacings, all characters have the same width) and
              proportional (characters have varying
              sizes). Proportional fonts usually look nicer;
               </para></listitem>

	  <listitem><para> character set <guilabel>registry</> and
              <guilabel>encoding</> - these two parameters, commonly
              referred to as <guilabel>character set</>, or
              <guilabel>charset</> for short, describe what set of
              symbols (or what alphabet) this font represents. There
              is a number of possible charsets. Some of the most
              popular ones include:
	      <itemizedlist mark="-">
		<listitem>
		  <para>
		    iso8859-1, also known as Latin 1,&mdash; this
		    character set includes all the symbols found on
		    the keyboard, i.e. Latin letters, punctuation
		    marks, numbers, symbols such as @ or $. It also
		    includes some special symbols, such as the
		    copyright sign, and a number of accented letters,
		    thus covering the needs of most Western European
		    languages (to be precise, Afrikaans, Basque,
		    Catalan, Danish, Dutch, English, Faeroese,
		    Finnish, French, Galician, German, Icelandic,
		    Irish, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Scottish,
		    Spanish, and Swedish).
		  </para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem><para>
		    iso8859-7 &mdash; includes Latin and
		    Greek alphabets 
		  </para></listitem> 
		<listitem><para>
		    iso8859-8 &mdash; includes Latin and
		    Hebrew alphabets 
		  </para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>
		    koi8-r &mdash; includes Latin and
		    Cyrillic alphabets 
		  </para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>
		    big5.eten.3.10-1 &mdash; Chinese
		    (Big5 encoding) 
		  </para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>
		    gb2312.1980-0&mdash;Chinese (GB encoding)
		  </para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>
		    jisx0208.1983-0&mdash;Japanese
		  </para></listitem>
	      </itemizedlist>


	    </para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
      </para>
      <para>
	The remaining font attributes (<guilabel>Set Width</>,
	<guilabel>Additional Style</>, and <guilabel>Average Width</>)
	are rarely used and therefore we skip their description.
      </para>
      <para>
	Full XLFD specifications are included in technical documentation for
	the X Window system and can be found online at <ulink type=ftp
           url="ftp://ftp.x.org/pub/R6.4/xc/doc/hardcopy/XLFD">    
	  ftp://ftp.x.org/pub/R6.4/xc/doc/hardcopy/XLFD</ulink>; most probably,
	you will never need it.
