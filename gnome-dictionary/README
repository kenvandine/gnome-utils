This is the development branch of the new GNOME Dictionary.

The old code resides in gnome-utils/gdictsrc, and should be considered
deprecated as soon as this code reaches HEAD.

WARNING: This code is *EXPERIMENTAL* and could break at any given time.
Since the dictionary source configuration system needs to load files from
DATADIR/gdict-1.0, you must install those files using "make install".  You
should really use a new prefix, in order to avoid tainting your system; as a
reference, here's my ./autogen.sh command line:

	$ ./autogen.sh --prefix=/opt/gnome2 \
	> --disable-gtk-doc \
	> --disable-schemas-install

+++

Source tree:

data/
	contains Glade files for the UI; the .server file and menu description
	file for the applet; GConf schemas; the .desktop for the application.

docs/
  reference/
	gtk-doc magic needed for the Gdict reference guide.

help/
	the help for the application and the applet.

libgdict/ 
	contains the Gdict library, which is the engine upon which both the
	application and the applet are built;

src/
	contains the application and the applet sources.

CAVEAT: This code is still in a state of flux; please, mail me before working
or committing to this branch.
