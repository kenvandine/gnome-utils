	* menubox.c: Apply patch from voss@debian.org (Jochen Voss) and
	  also apply the change to the non-gnome portion.  Basically
	  standard dialog has one 3 return values and we were returning
	  really bogus ones, that is, we returned the number of the menu item
	  but that's not standard.

	* inputbox.c, textbox.c, menubox.c: Fix focus issues and basically
	  make it work more like the standard dialog and actually the
	  same as the console dialog version.

	* guage.c, rc.c:  use g_snprintf instead of sprintf
