This is ANOTHER, configurable try at a Document/View model.

It consists of the following classes:
 - GnomeMDI
 - GnomeDocument
 - GnomeMDIPouch
 - GnomeMDIRoo
The latter two being a bit neglected and therefore currently not functioning
well.

Don't get put away by the fact that the thing is called MDI, actually
the MFC-like MDI does not even work yet.

It consists of a GnomeMDI object, that controls how the MDI will look
like and a GnomeDocument object that defines common stuff for any document
type: actual documents are derived from it. Any GtkWidget can serve as a
view: the example uses GtkHex from GHex.

GnomeMDI currently supports multiple toplevel windows or notebooks with
ability to drag pages into new toplevel windows (by dragging the page to
the root window). The MS-like MDI does not work right now (this would
require a lot of work on the widgets and anyway most people seem to
dislike it ;)).

GnomeMDI supports multiple views of the same document and takes care of
updating the views when the document data is changed.

GnomeMDI takes care of automatic combining of global menus that apply
to each document type and document-specific menus that are defined by
each document class. It also keeps a Document list menu containing all
currently open documents. 

The dynamic mode changing SEEMS to work now.

To test just build mditest (a simple hex editor) and run it. Currently
supported options are --book for notebook mode, --toplevel for multiple
toplevel windows and --modal for a modal app with a list of documents.

This stuff still requires much work, but I would like some feedback first.
