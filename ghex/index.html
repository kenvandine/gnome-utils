<A NAME="introduction"></A>2. Introduction</H2>
GHex (the <B>G</B>NOME <B>Hex </B>Editor) is a small tool that enables
you, its user, to view and edit contents of any file in hex and as ASCII
text. It is supposed to be a part of the GNOME project and tries to nicely
integrate with its other components and conform to the general guidelines
for GNOME applications.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H2>
<A NAME="use"></A>3. Use</H2>
When starting GHex, it will pop up a window with a <A HREF="#menubar">menubar</A>,
a <A HREF="#toolbar">toolbar</A> and a <A HREF="#statusbar">statusbar</A>
at the bottom. When a file is loaded, its contents will be displayed between
the statusbar and the toolbar in an area that will occupy the largest part
of the window. The contents are displayed in both hex and ascii at once,
with hexadecimal values on the left and the corresponding ascii representation
of those bytes on the right-hand side of the display.
<H4>
<A NAME="menubar"></A>The menubar</H4>
Menu <I>File</I>
<UL>
<LI>
<I>Open </I>lets you select a file and opens it, reading its contents to
a buffer and displaying it immediately. If you have previously been editing
another file, its contents are still left in the memory and you can return
to it at any time by choosing it from the <I>Buffers</I> menu.</LI>

<LI>
<I>Save </I>writes the contents of the buffer to the file with the same
name. Be careful with this since you can easily corrupt many files that
correspond to a given format.</LI>

<LI>
<I>Save As </I>lets you select a filename and then saves the contents of
the buffer to a file with this name.</LI>

<LI>
<I>Revert </I>reloads the contents of the buffer from the file.</LI>

<LI>
<I>Close </I>removes the buffer from the memory.</LI>

<LI>
<I>Quit </I>should be obvious: it quits GHex.</LI>
</UL>
Menu <I>Edit</I>
<UL>
<LI>
<I>Find </I>opens the <A HREF="#findnreplace">Find Dialog</A></LI>

<LI>
<I>Replace </I>opens the <A HREF="#findnreplace">Find &amp; Replace Dialog</A></LI>

<LI>
<I>Goto Byte </I>opens the Jump To Byte Dialog</LI>
</UL>
Menu <I>Options</I>
<UL>
<LI>
<I>Group Data As </I>offers three different ways how the bytes in the hex
display are grouped: either as single bytes or in groups of two bytes (words)
or four bytes (long words).</LI>

<LI>
<I>Select Font </I>lets you select the font that will be used to display
data. The display won't work correctly unless this is a monospaced font
(a font where all the characters have the same width). Examples of a monospaced
font are Courier or Fixed that should appear on most X Window systems.</LI>
</UL>
Menu <I>Buffers</I>
<UL>
<LI>
Displays names of all the files that are still open. You can access any
of them by simply picking them from this menu.</LI>
</UL>
Menu <I>Help</I>
<UL>
<LI>
<I>About </I>shows you what GHex is and who is responsible for it.</LI>
</UL>

<H4>
<A NAME="toolbar"></A>The toolbar</H4>
contains just four buttons, that serve the same purpose as the corresponding
menu items: <I>Open, Save, Revert </I>and <I>Close</I>
<H4>
<A NAME="statusbar"></A>The statusbar</H4>
is divided in three parts. The leftmost label displays the name of the
file that you are currently editing, the middle one displays the cursor
position in bytes and the size of the edited file and the rightmost label
displays the decimal value of the byte, word and longword that the cursor
is on.
<H4>
Editing a file</H4>
You can move around the file using the arrow keys, the numeric keypad,
the scrollbar on the left of the buffer display or by clicking into display
with a mouse. Clicking into the hex or ascii display will activate hex
or ascii editing mode. The active display is indicated by a full cursor,
while the other one displays cursor as an outline. In ascii mode, you can
edit the file pretty much as with any text editor except that GHex will
not let you insert any data but only overwrite it. In hex mode, you can
change the value of the nibble (four bits, a half of a byte) under the
cursor with keys '0' .. '9' and 'a' .. 'f'.
<H4>
<A NAME="findnreplace"></A>Finding and replacing data</H4>
Selecting <I>Find </I>from the <I>Edit </I>menu will bring up the Find
Dialog. It allows you to search the file for a string that you can enter
in either hex or ascii. To find an ascii string, simply enter it into the
entry widget and click on the <I>Find Next </I>or <I>Find Previous</I>
button. You can specify the value to be found in hex if you begin the string
with a <I>$</I>: searching for "$474e55" is the same as searching for "GNU".
If you really need to search for an ascii string beginning with a <I>$</I>
character, you can escape the leading <I>$</I> with <I>$$</I>: "$$GNU"
represents string "$GNU".
<BR>Replacing data is much alike, except that you have to enter both a
string to be found and a string that will replace the found value. Both
strings must be of the same length (because GHex allows only overwriting
of data and no insertion). The <I>Find Next </I>button will search for
the next occurence of the string from the first entry widget, the <I>Replace
</I>button will replace the data if the cursor is on the beginning of a
string that equals to the searched-for one and then search for the next
occurence, if the cursor is not positioned on the beginning of the searched-for
string, it will try to find the next occurence of it, but will not replace
that one. Finally, the <I>Replace All </I>button will replace all occurences
of the searched-for string from the current cursor position to the end
of the file.
