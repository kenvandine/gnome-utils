<A NAME="introduction"></A>2. Introduction</H2>
GHex (the <B>G</B>NOME <B>Hex </B>Editor) is a small tool that enables
you, its user, to view and edit contents of any file in hex and as ASCII
text. It is supposed to be a part of the GNOME desktop environment and
tries to nicely integrate with its other components and conform to the
general guidelines for GNOME applications.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H2>
<A NAME="use"></A>3. Use</H2>
When starting GHex, it will pop up a window with nothing but a
<A HREF="#menubar">menubar</A>. When a file is loaded, its contents will
be displayed below the menubar in an area that will occupy the largest part
of the window. The contents are displayed in both hex and ascii at once, with
hexadecimal values on the left and the corresponding ascii representation of
those bytes on the right-hand side of the display.
<H4>
<A NAME="menubar"></A>The menubar</H4>
Menu <I>File</I>
<UL>
<LI>
<I>Open </I>lets you select a file and opens it, reading its contents to
a buffer and displaying it immediately in a view.</LI>

<LI>
<I>Save </I>writes the contents of the buffer to the file with the same
name. Be careful with this since you can easily corrupt many files that
correspond to a given format.</LI>

<LI>
<I>Save As </I>lets you select a filename and then saves the contents of
the buffer to a file with this name.</LI>

<LI>
<I>Revert </I>reloads the contents of the file.</LI>

<LI>
<I>Close </I>closes all views and removes the file from the memory.</LI>

<LI>
<I>Open Converter... </I>opens the <A HREF="#converter">Base Conversion
Dialog</A></LI>

<LI>

display are grouped: either as single bytes or in groups of two bytes (words)
or four bytes (long words).</LI>
</UL>
Menu <I>View</I>
<UL>
<LI>
<I>Add view</I> adds another view of the currently edited file.</LI>

of the corresponding file, the file will not be closed and will remain
accessible through the <I>Files</I> menu</LI>

<H4>
Editing a file</H4>
You can move around the file using the arrow keys, the numeric keypad,
the scrollbar on the left of the buffer display or by clicking into display
with a mouse. Clicking into the hex or ascii display will activate hex
or ascii editing mode. The active display is indicated by a full cursor,
while the other one displays cursor as an outline. In ascii mode, you can
edit the file pretty much as with any text editor except that GHex will
not let you insert any data but only overwrite it. In hex mode, you can
change the value of the nibble (four bits, a half of a byte) under the
cursor with keys '0' .. '9' and 'a' .. 'f'.
<H4>
<A NAME="findnreplace"></A>Finding and replacing data</H4>
Selecting <I>Find </I>from the <I>Edit </I>menu will bring up the Find
Dialog. It allows you to search the file for a string that you can enter
in either hex or ascii. To find an ascii string, simply enter it into the
entry widget and click on the <I>Find Next </I>or <I>Find Previous</I>
button. You can choose in which form (either hex or ASCII) you wish to
enter the search string with the two radio buttons below the entry widget
<BR>Replacing data is much alike, except that you have to enter both a
string to be found and a string that will replace the found value. Both
strings must be of the same length (because GHex allows only overwriting
of data and no insertion). The <I>Find Next </I>button will search for
the next occurence of the string from the first entry widget, the <I>Replace
</I>button will replace the data if the cursor is on the beginning of a
string that equals to the searched-for one and then search for the next
occurence, if the cursor is not positioned on the beginning of the searched-for
string, it will try to find the next occurence of it, but will not replace
that one. Finally, the <I>Replace All </I>button will replace all occurences
of the searched-for string from the current cursor position to the end
of the file.
<H4>
<A NAME="converter"></A>Base Conversion Dialog</H4>
Shows you up to four bytes of data as their binary, decimal, hexadecimal
and ASCII&nbsp;representation. The values automatically update when you
change data in any entry.
