What is GHex
============

GHex allows the user to load data from any file, view and edit it in either hex or
ascii. A must for anyone playing games that use non-ascii format for saving.


System Requirements
===================

GHex should build on (I guess) most unices. It needs the X11R6 libraries,
glib, gdk and gtk 1.1.x libraries and GNOME-0.30 libraries.


Use
===

Read the documentation: ghex.html (which is rather outdated)


Invitation :)
=============

If anyone (surprisingly) wishes to improve GHex, have a look at the TODO
list, but don't limit yourself to what is described therein. Send patches
to my email address.
