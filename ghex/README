What is GHex
============

GHex allows the user to load data from any file, view and edit it in either hex or
ascii. A must for anyone playing games that use non-ascii format for saving.


System Requirements
===================

GHex should build on (I guess) most unices. It needs the X11R6 libraries, the GTK/GDK
libraries and GNOME libraries. I believe the ones from the Gnome-0.13 and Gtk+-0.99.5
distributions should do, but I haven't tried them: if you have problems building ghex
(unresolved symbols, wrong numbers of arguments, etc.) get the gnome-libs and gtk+
modules from the Gnome CVS.


Installation
============

Well, since I haven't been good enough to get to know the GNU auto**** stuff,
you'll have to manually adjust the Makefile to your system (you need the GTK/GDK
and GNOME includes and libs in your include and library paths) and then simply type
'make'. If all goes well, this will leave you with an executable called 'ghex' in
your working directory and you can play with it.


Use
===

Read the documentation: ghex.html


Invitation :)
=============

If anyone (surprisingly) wishes to improve GHex, have a look at the TODO list,
but don't limit yourself to what is described therein. Send patches to my email
address.
