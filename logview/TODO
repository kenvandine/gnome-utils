- If the selected row is a "Date" row (ie a toplevel-expander-kind of row) and the user copies it,
we should copy all the loglines for the selected day.

- Use some kind of authentification tool (libgnomesu ? gksudo ?) to ask for the root password at launch.

- Use gnome-vfs (if safe) to monitor the logs instead of a timeout. I've tried it, it doesn't work right
now (there's no notification, perhaps something is screwed up on my setup).
