2002-08-29  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* logview.c: Remove StubCall ()

2002-07-31  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* logview.c: s/About.../About. Fixes #89481.

2002-07-26  Deepa Natarajan  <deepa.natarajan@wipro.com>

	* log_repaint.c, logrtns.c, logview.h: When logview first 
	comes up set focus on the last row and scroll to that row.

	* logview.[ch], log_repaint.c: Maintain the correct status

2002-07-24  Deepa Natarajan  <deepa.natarajan@wipro.com>

	* actions.c: Modified exec_action_in_db() to execute "action"
	by a combination of fork() and execlp() calls instead of
	executing through system().  There is a potential of Time of
	Check and Time of Use (TOCTOU) issues with system() since
	shell is spawned first and command's executed after a small
	time gap. Fixes #87110.

2002-07-08  Deepa Natarajan  <deepa.natarajan@wipro.com> 
 
	* logview.[ch], log_repaint.c: Append filename to the window 
	title. Disable Close and Properties option when all files are

	maintain the tree view paths that are expanded in a file. 
	Used when switching between logs.

	logview.c: Display logs in the form of a tree view placed 
	inside a scrolled window. Set up 2 call backs: row-activated 
	for showing zoom window and selection changed to update the 
	current log line. Removed all canvas and scroll window stuff.

	log_repaint.c: Rewrote to use GtkTreeView. Clean up #defines.
	Add save_row_to_expand(): to save paths that are currently 
	expanded. Remove HandleLogKeyboard as it does not follow HIG. 
	Remove all Pango stuff. Restore session is disabled for now.

	log based on the new log structure. Convert description to utf8 
	before passing it to GtkListStore.

	monitor.c: When the monitoring logs first comes up, display 
	only the last 5 lines. Remove all page stuff. Right now 
	updation of logs is disabled. Clean up #defines. 

	menus.c, userprefdialog.c: Do not set styles, to respect themes.

	calendar.c: The functionality of the calander is currently
	disabled.

2002-06-14  Narayana Pattipati <narayana.pattipati@wipro.com>

        * monitor.c: Update the monitor window with the new lines added 
        properly. And also make sure that the last log is also shown when
        monitor window opened first. Bug#85248

2002-06-19  Deepa Natarajan  <deepa.natarajan@wipro.com>
 
	* actions.c: Change the windows to dialog boxes. Set
	atk relation between entry box and label, set mnemonics,
	set default button, change title of dialog to "Actions",
	position buttons to the right of the tree view. 
	s/gtk_widget_set_usize/gtk_widget_set_size_request.

	* monitor.c: s/GtkWindow/GtkDialog, add mnemonics,
	set tooltips - thanks Parag, expand some of the
	labels, change the ordering of the buttons, put all
	the button in the same row, change the title of the 
	dialog to "Monitor Options" and set the default button.
	s/gtk_widget_set_usize/gtk_widget_set_size_request.

2002-06-12  Narayana Pattipati <narayana.pattipati@wipro.com>

        update the current position and start reading next set of lines from 
        the new position.

        * logrtns.c: In ReadPageDown function fixed a crash when the lines
        read are more than ten. Bug#84084.

2002-06-12  Christophe Merlet  <christophe@merlet.net>

	* Makefile.am: Add $DESTDIR variable.

2002-06-04  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* logview.c: use _UI_SUBTREE instead of _UI_SUBTREE_STOCK since 
	that makes translations actually work. _UI_SUBTREE_STOCK means
	that the string comes from libgnomeui which in this case it 
	doesn't.

2002-05-31  Hidetoshi Tajima <hidetoshi.tajima@sun.com>

	* Makefile.am: Update for #83627.

2002-05-31  Hidetoshi Tajima <hidetoshi.tajima@sun.com>

	* Makefile.am: Fix GNOMELOCALEDIR to point to correct
	place. Fixes #83627.

2002-05-25  Glynn Foster <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* logview.c, actions.c: Some focus issues. Hum, we really
	need to get mnemonics going here.

2002-05-25  Narayana Pattipati <narayana.pattipati@wipro.com>

	* logview.c: Treeview fix to prevent parent and child being
	created for first action entry. Fixes #81942.

2002-15-20 Glynn Foster <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* Makefile.am: Diable docs until they are fixed - dtd validation
	problems with scrollkeeper.dtd.

Fri May 17 10:09:46 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config.c: add note to translators about fonts, especially about
	  Helvetica vs asian fonts

	* info.c, zoom.c: fix crashes on window closing, also add more
	  elaborate logic for figuring out the size of the label area,
	  still quite stupid, but now it gets it wrong by getting more space
	  rather then less which is nicer.  Also better get single char
	  width info in an uglier, more elaborate and hackish way but
	  in a way that we get more correct.  Some more geometry fixage
	  to get asian fonts right.

Thu May 16 18:39:42 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* info.c, log_repaint.c, logview.h, misc.c, zoom.c:
	  handle cases where we can't convert the line to utf8.  We can
	  really guess the language anyway though so maybe we could do more.

	* logrtns.c: make sure not to leave other time locales around and
	  fix a leak thus created.

Thu May 16 18:19:59 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* info.c, log_repaint.c, logrtns.c, logview.h, misc.c, zoom.c:
	  Some i18n fixage, especially with getting utf8 vs locale
	  encoding straight.  It is quite ugly, though now we again read
	  localized logs and don't spew out tons of warnings.  I can't make
	  sure that the problem for Chinese is gone since I think I don't
	  have the right fonts for this.  So I'll mark #81252 as fixed.

Thu May 16 15:20:35 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* logview.c: make the window and make sure it's shown before opening
	  files since then we look like we are loading faster, especially if
	  your logfile is very long.

Thu May 16 15:09:19 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* log_repaint.c, zoom.c: partially fix #81252 by converting output
	  of strftime to utf8.  Also convert the string to utf8, this still
	  needs a bit of work, so I'm not closing the bug yet

	* logview.c: fix crash when closing window

2002-05-14  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* gnome-system-log-actions.db: Comment out example
	strings. I wish I am more time to look through this 
	properly.

2002-05-11 Samuel Stringham  <sams@e-sa.com> 

	* logrtns.c: On log rotation, or log creation, 
	or just empty logs logview fails.  Tough to tell if 
	a log is actually a system log when it is empty, but 
	should still try to read/monitor it. Fixes #81348.

2002-05-11  Samuel Stringham  <sams@e-sa.com>
	
	* actions.c: Fix crash in actions dialog. Fixes #81397.

2002-05-11  Samuel Stringham  <sams@e-sa.com>

	out by the doc team.

2002-05-08  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* calendar.c, log_repaint.c, logview.c, zoom.c: More
	HIG Compliance stuff. Fixes #76685 in part. Man, this 
	code is *so* ugly. Hack after hack after hack. [sigh].

2002-05-07  Samuel Stringham <sams@e-sa.com>

	* zoom.c: (repaint_zoom): Fix repaint on zoom-in box. Fixes	
	#80904.

2002-05-07  Samuel Stringham <sams@e-sa.com>

2002-05-07  Satyajit Kanungo  <satyajit.kanungo@wipro.com>

	* gnome-system-log.desktop.in: Added DocPath in the 
	desktop.in file. Fixes #80921.

2002-05-03  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* logview.c: s/Date/Last Modified. It seems a slightly better
	solution, although when you scroll up it seems to randomly
	change the date in the status bar. Fixes #72782 somewhat
	but we should get rid of the updates and just use one non
	changing date, whatever that might be.
	* logrtns.c: Include <errno.h> in the view to giving more 
	useful error messages.
 
2002-05-03  Xing Wang <quixon@gnuchina.org>

	* calendar.c: (CalendarMenu), (close_calendar): Don't NULL

	in the about dialog.  Change name to match application menu.
	Fixes #80109.
	
2002-04-24 Aruna P R <aruna.pou@wipro.com>

	* config.c, info.c, log_repaint.c, logview.c,
	  logview.h, monitor.c, zoom.c:

	Start using Pango wherever we can.

        * monitor.c: Monitor options gives the messages when tried to add more
        than the MON_MAX_NUM_LOGS(4) log files.
        Fixes the problem with Add and Remove button

        * logview.c: made menu items and view items sensitive.
        Added the condition to give the message when tried to open more than
