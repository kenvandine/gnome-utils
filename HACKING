GNOME Utilities HACKING -

Please send patches to any of the people listed in the MAINTAINERS file
or, alternatively, attach them to a bugzilla.gnome.org report.

* Branches

        gnome-2-18
        gnome-2-16
        gnome-2-14

These branches are in deep code freeze. Please do not commit even the most
simple bug fixes to it without emailing the release team
release-team@gnome.org and MAINTAINERS, getting a confirmation of commit 
from 2 release team members.

	gnome-utils-1-4

This branch is now obsolete stable. No bugs will be fixed on this branch
anymore, and no more new releases will be made.

Patches should be sent using the unified diff format; no normal, no ed style,
just use:

	svn diff --diff-cmd=diff -x -Nuarp > some-patch.diff

on a modified source tree.

* Special notice for libgdict

Even though libgdict is not inside the Developers Platform, the same rules
(even if a bit more lax) apply to it:

	- no ABI breaking, unless is absolutely unavoidable;
	- no ABI/API breaking after ABI/API freeze;
	- every API change must be *fully* documented;

If you intend to change the API for libgdict, contact Emmanuele Bassi (see
the MAINTAINERS file) and kindly provide a rationale for the API change,
with a use case and, possibly, a test case. In case of a patch (see above
for the diff format), kindly provide:

	- documentation (in gtk-doc form);
	- a test case;

The versioning scheme for libgdict should follow this ruleset:

	if release is the first of a new development cycle:
  		major += 1;
		minor = micro = 0;
	else if release is before API freeze:
		minor += 1;
	else if release is after API freeze:
		micro += 1;
