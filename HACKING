GNOME Utilities HACKING

Please send patches to any of the people listed in the MAINTAINERS file
or, alternatively, attach them to a bugzilla.gnome.org report.

Features that require a patchset or discussion are to be sent to the
gnome-utils mailing list for review.

If you want to implement a complex feature you can request a branch
on the mailing list; the branch will be merged when the maintainers will
deem it ready. GNOME is using SVN which makes branches cheap, but
merging is still a pain; thus, what will be merged will not have a full
history.

* Branches

        gnome-2-26
        gnome-2-24
        gnome-2-22
        gnome-2-20
        ...

These branches are in deep code freeze. Please do not commit even the most
simple bug fixes to it without emailing the release team
release-team@gnome.org and MAINTAINERS, getting a confirmation of commit 
from 2 release team members.

* Special notice for libgdict

Even though libgdict is not inside the Developers Platform, the same rules
(even if a bit more lax) apply to it:

	- no ABI breaking, unless is absolutely unavoidable;
	- no ABI/API breaking after ABI/API freeze;
	- every API change must be *fully* documented;

If you intend to change the API for libgdict, contact Emmanuele Bassi (see
the MAINTAINERS file) and kindly provide a rationale for the API change,
with a use case and, possibly, a test case. In case of a patch (see above
for the diff format), kindly provide:

	- documentation (in gtk-doc form);
	- a test case;

The versioning scheme for libgdict should follow this ruleset:

	if release is the first of a new development cycle:
  		major += 1;
		minor = micro = 0;
	else if release is before API freeze:
		minor += 1;
	else if release is after API freeze:
		micro += 1;
