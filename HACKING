GNOME Utilities HACKING -

Please send patches to any of the people listed in the MAINTAINERS file
or, alternatively, attach them to a bugzilla.gnome.org report.

gnome-2-0 branch -

This branch is in deep code freeze. Please do not commit even the most
simple bug fixes to it without emailing the GNOME 2 release team
gnome2-release-team@gnome.org and getting a confirmation of commit from
2 release team members.

HEAD -

While it is free to commit changes to this branch, it is not in GNOME's
best interest to do large 'feature' hacking right now. We need to come
up with a good plan for where we are going with this. TBD.
