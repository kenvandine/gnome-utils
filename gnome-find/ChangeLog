	* gnome-find.c, gnome-find.h, specs.c: First pass at a find GUI,
 	still needs some cleaning up, and needs to be taught to talk to
 	nfind.

	* getdate.y: Flexible date parser from CVS, still need to fix to
 	deal with future times better, provide I18N.

	* glob.c: Glob to regexp translator. Translates shell-style globs
 	with `*', `?', `[...]' and `{... , ...}' operators into regular
 	expressions.

	* nfind.c: Fast `find' core. Does not handle any operators for
 	now.
