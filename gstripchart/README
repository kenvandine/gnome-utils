**** DEPRECATED:
  The gstripchart program has been deprecated.  It has been replaced
  by the stripchart program.  Don't bother maintaining this.  It will
  be removed at some point in the near future.

The gstripchart program generates a stripchart-like plot of one or
more time-variant data values.  Typically, gstripchart will be used to
plot performance metrics such as system load and net traffic.
However, its input mechanism is sufficently general purpose that the
program is adaptable to a broad range of plotting tasks.

Most of the rest of the stuff that you'd expect to find in a README
file is in the gstripchart/help/C/index.html file.  Check there
instead.  The buglist is in the TODO file.  Patches are welcomed.
