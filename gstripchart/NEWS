	* Thanks to Scot E. Wilcoxon <swilcoxo@ford.com>, the help
	file has been cleaned up, and there's a pattern for battery
	charge in the configuration file.

	* Allow parameters to be scaled logarithmically as well as
          linearly.

	* Add a "Scale" column to the text-popup window.

	* Refresh the text popup window whenever the chart window is

	* Provide a gstripchart applet in addition to the gstripchart
	application.

	* Only read swap parameters occasionally.  This innocuous
	sounding change saves a huge amount of processing time.

1999-08-29

	* Changed configuration file to use libgtop parameters rather
	than reading and processing /proc entries directly.  This
	should improve portability to non-Linux systems.

	* On Linux systems, use internal routine to display network
	traffic on all interfaces.

	* Change PPP status monitor to detect a ppp pid file rather
	than reading /proc.

	stripchart icon.

	* Added session management support.

1999-04-10

	* Added status indicators -- little boxes in the upper left
	corner that turn different colors based on parameter values.
	Use this feature to show when ppp0 is up.

1999-01-24

	* Added a text popup window to display the current values of
	all parameters.  This pops up in response to a mouse-button-1
	click.

1998-12-25

	* When adjusting the full-scale value of a parameter, select a
	value of the form {1,2,5}*10eN.

1998-12-20

	* Added a dialog window with notebook pages showing the
	settings of each parameter with a radio button to toggle each
	active flag.

1998-12-19

	* Establish a reasonable initial sizes for the main window.

1998-10-25
