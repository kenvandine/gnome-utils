BUGS TO BE SQUASHED

The code to process a command option error leaves trailing cruft after
the command name, and includes all the gnome-internal options but
omits the long-named variants of the gstripchart options.  This seems
like it's caused by an error in the popt routines.

The help browser doesn't jump to the name tags listed in the
topics.dat file.  Instead, the help file always loads the help page
starting at the top of the file.  As far as I can tell, this doesn't
work for any other apps either, so I'll assume that the problem lies
with the help browser.

Figure out how to account for WM decorations when dealing with a
geometry string that specify a position relative to the bottom or
right side.


FEATURES TO BE ADDED

Rework the param menu pop-up so that the fields in existing parameters
are readily editable, and so that new paramaters can be added.

Add session management code.

Add an option to include legends along the sides of the display.  The
vertical legend could include the name and last value of each
parameter.  This could get crowded in a hurry.

Allow the background color to be defined on the command line and in
the config file.


THINGS TO CONSIDER

Re-work the text popup and the parameter dialog box to show 3
significant digits in as narrow a field as possible.  Update the text
popup in real time, or make it go away on a button release.

Allow values to be plotted using a logarithmic basis rather than a
linear one.  This would be especially handy for values such as load
which is normally very low, but which can jump way up at times.

Allow fields to be split on delimtiers other than whitespace and
colon, then eliminate the colon from the seperator list and add it to
the net I/O items.

Use regular expressions instead of strstr for field matching and
strtok for splitting?  This would be more versatile, but would also
make the code dependent on some regex package.  I'll probably wait
until the existing scheme proves itself inadequate.
