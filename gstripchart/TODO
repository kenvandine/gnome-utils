BUGS TO BE SQUASHED

The code to process a command option error leaves trailing cruft after
the command name, and includes all the gnome-internal options but
omits the long-named varients of the gstripchart options.

Resizing only works when enlarging the size of the window from its
default value.  When shrinking the window, stuff on the RHS gets
squeezed out of the window.  This is driving me nuts.  It's got to be
something simple, but I can't see what it is.  Also, there seems to be
a race condition such that the chart doesn't get redrawn for a few
seconds after making a sudden, large increase in the size of the window.

The help browser doesn't jump to the name tags listed in the
topics.dat file.  Instead, the help file always loads the help page
starting at the top of the file.  As far as I can tell, this doesn't
work for any other apps either, so I'll assume that the problem lies
outside of gstripchart.


FEATURES TO BE ADDED

Add session management code.  Also, figure out how to account for WM
decorations when dealing with a geometry string that specify a
position relative to the lower or right sides.

Use notebook pages for configuration.  Have a right-click pop up a
configuration notebook.  This should probably be written using one of
the GUI config tools, such as Linuxconf or COAS.

Add auto-ranging.  Having to manually specify the range for a value is
too awkward.

Add an option to include legends along the sides of the display.  The
vertical legend could include the name and last value of each
parameter.  This could get crowded in a hurry.

Allow values to be plotted using a logarithmic basis rather than a
linear one.  This would be especially handy for values such as load
which is normally very low, but which can jump way up at times.

Don't draw a line if there's no value available.  For example, it
should be possible to distinguish between a 'net connection down'
condition and a 'no net traffic' condition.  This will require some
type of conditional test in the config setup.

Allow the background color and geometry parameters to be defined on
the command line and in the config file.

Catch a SIGHUP and re-read the config file.  This would be handier
than stopping and restarting on each change to the configuration file.

Allow fields to be split on delimtiers other than whitespace and
colon, then eliminate the colon from the seperator list and add it to
the net I/O items.

Use regular expressions instead of strstr for field matching and
strtok for splitting?  This would be more versatile, but would also
make the code dependent on some regex package.  I'll probably wait
until the existing scheme proves itself inadequate.

Grep for FIX THIS.  Fix that.  Remember the .html as well.
