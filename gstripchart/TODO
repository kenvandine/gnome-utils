FEATURES TO BE ADDED

Rework the param menu pop-up so that the fields in existing parameters
are readily editable, and so that new paramaters can be added.
Perhaps the best way to do this would be to write a COAS CLAM or a
Linuxconf module to handle the configuration, and then pop that up
from the "Parameter" menu item.

Add an option to include legends along the sides of the display.  The
vertical legend could include the name and last value of each
parameter.  This could get crowded in a hurry.

Create a parameter that isn't displayed, but is used only as an
intermediate value.  This would allow computing things that require
reading from more than a single file, etc.

Allow the background color to be defined on the command line and in
the config file -- or should this be done exclusively through the Gtk
style mechanism?


THINGS TO CONSIDER

Use regular expressions instead of strstr for field matching and
strtok for splitting?  This would be more versatile, but would also
make the code dependent on some regex package.  I'll probably wait
until the existing scheme proves itself inadequate.


BUGS TO BE SQUASHED

Figure out how to account for WM decorations when dealing with a
geometry string that specify a position relative to the bottom or
right side.  Also, the menubar isn't compensated for when sizing the
main frame -- should it be?
