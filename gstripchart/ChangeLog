1999-10-24  John Kodis  <kodis@jagunet.com>

	* gstripchart.c Added some applet code, currently #ifdef'd out.
	(gtop_vars): In the interest of brevity, renamed libgtop parameter
	names in the loadavg family from loadavg_whatever to
	load_whatever.

	* gstripchart.conf (Busy): Use cpu_total and cpu_idle to compute
	CPU busy percentage.  This requires much less numerical precision
	than the former method of using uptime and idletime.

	* gstripchart.c (glibtop_get_swap_occasionally): New routine to
	reduce the amount of CPU time gstripchart uses by only reading
	swap statistics once per 15 seconds.

1999-09-26  John Kodis  <kodis@jagunet.com>

	* gstripchart.c (read_param_defns): Don't allow the display type
	to be specified in the configuration file.  It's too hard to get
	the initialization, color name scanning, and command line
	overrides to play together nicely.

1999-08-29  John Kodis  <kodis@jagunet.com>

	* gstripchart.conf (end): Change configuration file to use libgtop
	parameters rather than reading and processing /proc entries
	directly.  This should improve portability to non-Linux systems.
	Change PPP status monitor to detect a ppp pid file rather than
	reading /proc.

	* gstripchart.c: Change status_outline default to off.
	(update_values): Omit values generated during the
	first three passes from the history array.  This prevents
	initialization spikes from affecting the parameter range
	calculations.
	(get_all_netload): New routine to get info on network traffic
	through all interfaces.
	(gtop_value): Added delta argument and code to return delta values
	for libgtop parameters.
	(arglist): Re-order popt option strings.  The --usage output from
	popt still looks a bit odd.

1999-08-28  John Kodis  <kodis@jagunet.com>

	* gstripchart.c (text_popup): Use a TOPLEVEL rather than a POPUP
	window for the pop-up value display window.  Swapped the order of
	text_load_clist() and gtk_widget_show(), as the proper sequence
	appears to have changed recently.
	(proc_arg): Call gnome_client_disable_master_connection() for all
	non-graphical modes of operation.
	(read_param_defns): Added a gettext() string wrapper.
	(prefs_callback): Added several gettext() string wrappers.

1999-08-22  John Kodis  <kodis@jagunet.com>

	* gstripchart.c (prefs_callback): Removed an '#if 0' section of
	code containing gettext_noop macros with various color names.
	This section was added as part of the i18n effort, but isn't
	required.  The color names are taken from the X11 rgb.txt file,
	and so are not subject to translation.

1999-08-15  Matthias Warkus  <mawa@iname.com>

	* gnome-stripchart.png: New icon by Ben Frantzdale.
	* Makefile.am: Installs gnome-stripchart.png.
	* gstripchart.desktop: Uses gnome-stripchart.png.

1999-05-31  John Kodis  <kodis@jagunet.com>

	* gstripchart.c: Added i18n support by wrapping most user-visible
	strings with the _() macro.  Bumped version number to 1.6, just
	because it's been a while.  Changed the default size from 160x80
	to 200x50.

1999-05-26  John Kodis  <kodis@jagunet.com>

	* gstripchart.c (save_handler): Added session management support.
	This turned out to be relatively few lines of code.  I should have
	done it sooner.

1999-05-16  John Kodis  <kodis@jagunet.com>

	* gstripchart.c (read_param_defns): Add status-outline config
	parameter, to include or omit borders around status indicators.
	Also allow any number of status indicator colors to be specified.

	* gstripchart.c (num_op): Added a stripbl() call to eliminate an
	expression parsing error when some types of numbers were followed
	by whitespace.

1999-04-10  John Kodis  <kodis@jagunet.com>

	* gstripchart.c (overlay_status_box): First cut at status
	indicators added.

	* gstripchart.conf: Added status indicators for ppp0 up and ppp0
	active.

1999-02-06  Changwoo Ryu  <cwryu@adam.kaist.ac.kr>

	* gstripchart.desktop: Added Korean translations.

	* gstripchart.c: Removed C++ style comments.

1999-01-24  John Kodis  <kodis@jagunet.com>

	* gstripchart.c (hi_lo_fmt): New function to format a pair of
	numbers in a compact format and with the same magnitude.
	(text_popup): New function to pop up a range summary of all
	parameters.  Activated by a mouse button 1 click.

1999-01-02  John Kodis  <kodis@jagunet.com>

	* gstripchart.c (text_popup): Split text_popup and menu_popup out
	from click_handler.  Changed from a text-based to a clist-based
	popup.

1999-01-01  John Kodis  <kodis@jagunet.com>

	* gstripchart.c (readjust_top_for_width): When readjusting
	parameter top values, insure that the new top value is no smaller
	than the user-specified maximum expected value.
	(update_values): Only readjust top values when requested.  Only
	request that this be done when updating the chart parameters in
	the chart_timer_handler routine.
	(main): Allocate slider arrays with calloc rather than malloc to
	avoid problems caused by evaluating random garbage.

1998-12-26  John Kodis  <kodis@jagunet.com>

	* gstripchart.c (readjust_top_for_width): New function to readjust
	the top values for the current display width.  Called from the
	chart window configuration event handler and from the params menu
	item okay and apply handlers.

	* gstripchart.c: Performed massive code rearrangement to move the
	num_val, new_val, and max_val items from the Param struct to the
	Param_glob struct.  Also eliminated the evil params, chart_param,
	and slider_param file-scope globals.

1998-12-19  Herbert Valerio Riedel  <hvr@hvrlab.ml.org>

	* gstripchart.c (update_values): Added explicit braces to
	eliminate a warning about an ambiguous if-clause.

1998-12-25  John Kodis  <kodis@jagunet.com>

	* gstripchart.c (chart_timer_handler): Fake an exposure event to
	redraw the chart pixmap whenever any scale value changes.

1998-12-25  John Kodis  <kodis@jagunet.com>

	* gstripchart.c (cap): New function used by update_values() to
	force top values to take on a value of the form {1,2,5}*10ex.

1998-12-20  John Kodis  <kodis@jagunet.com>

	* gstripchart.c (main): Hacked on popt stuff to ignore gnome
	options when processing gstripchart-specific options.  Usage is
	still broken.

1998-12-20  John Kodis  <kodis@jagunet.com>

	* gstripchart.c (prefs_callback): Added code to display the
	settings of a parameter, and to toggle the active flag for each
	parameter.

1998-12-19  John Kodis  <kodis@jagunet.com>

	* gstripchart.c (gtk_graph): Added calls to
	gtk_widget_set_{usize,default_size} to establish the minimum and
	initial sizes of the main window.

1998-12-13  John Kodis  <kodis@jagunet.com>

	* gstripchart.c (read_param_defns): if defined, add CONFDIR to the
	config file search path.

1998-12-06  John Kodis  <kodis@jagunet.com>

	* gstripchart.c (eval): make libgtop parameter conditioned upon
	HAVE_LIBGTOP.

1998-11-28  John Kodis  <kodis@jagunet.com>

	* gstripchart.c (popt_arg_extractor): changed from argp-based to
	 popt-based command line handling.

1998-10-25  John Kodis  <kodis@jagunet.com>

	* gstripchart.c (arglist): Changed --add_menubar switch to
	--menubar; also fixed it so that it now works.
	(gtk_graph): Handle geometry settings.

	* gstripchart.html: Added some documentation about the geometry
	option and the use of the libgtop variables.

1998-09-05  John Kodis  <kodis@jagunet.com>

	* gstripchart.c (read_param_defns): Initialized the `now' array to
	zero.
	(gtop_value): Added libgtop parameters as a source of plot data.

1998-08-27  John Kodis  <kodis@jagunet.com>

	* gstripchart.c (main): Allow config parameters to be overridden
	by command line options by adding two explicit argp_parse calls in
	place of the implicit call from gnome init.

1998-08-22  John Kodis  <kodis@jagunet.com>

	* gstripchart.c (overlay_tick_marks): New function.
	(read_param_defns): Add code to handle major/minor_tick parameter
	settings. 

	* gstripchart.html: Changed omit-menu entries to add-menubar
	entries. 

	* gstripchart.c (click_handler): Now correctly pops up a menu.
	(help_menu_action): Now correctly pops open a help browser to
	display the gstripchart help file.
	(main): Added textdomain calls to initialize the i18n stuff.
	(gtk_graph): Always do pop-up menu set-up; do menubar set-up if
	requested.

1998-08-17  John Kodis  <kodis@jagunet.com>

	* gstripchart.c (read_param_defns): Accept some command-line
	arguments as config file parameters.
	(click_handler): Add beginnings of pop-up menu support.
	(tc_to_lpf_const): Add low-pass filtering to chart and slider
	values.
