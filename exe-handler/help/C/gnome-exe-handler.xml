    <title>GNOME-exe-handler</title>
    <para>The <application>gnome-exe-handler</application> is a utility
      that other applications use to launch programs inside the
    <acronym>GNOME</acronym> environment. It checks to see if a file is
    executable, then prompts users to be sure they want to run the file. You can
    also run <application>gnome-exe-handler</application> directly from
    the command line. However, other applications usually invoke the
    utility. For example, the <application>Nautilus</application> file manager
    frequently invokes <application>gnome-exe-handler</application> when you
    double-click on a file name or icon.
    </para>

    <para>Typically, an application uses
    <application>gnome-exe-handler</application> to execute a binary file in a
    case where the permissions of a file have not been set to allow user execution. The
    <application>gnome-exe-handler</application> first tries to determine the
    type of file. If it appears to be executable,
    <application>gnome-exe-handler</application> prompts the user to
    determine whether the user wants to start the program. If the user answers
    "yes", <application>gnome-exe-handler</application> changes the
    permissions to allow the user to run the program.

      <warning>
	<para>Executing arbitrary programs you download from the Internet
	can be dangerous. Be sure you understand what a program is before you
	  permit <application>gnome-exe-handler</application> to run the
	program.</para>
