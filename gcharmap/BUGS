src/interface.c, src/callbacks.c:
* The character table has it's own font style.
  But for some reason, the font isn't showed in the button.
  The font picker doesn't work.
  I can't find the cause of this problem.

src/main.c:
* Every time this file is compiled I get a warning at this line:
  bindtextdomain (PACKAGE, GNOMELOCALEDIR);
  textdomain (PACKAGE);

  It's something about "statement with no effect".

po/nl.po:
* File does not get installed so localization doesn't work.
  (why????)
