<H1>Chapter 2 - Tutorial</H1>
<BR>

<A NAME="1"><H2>1. Getting started</H2>
Start Gnome Character Map :-)

<A NAME="2"><H2>2. Select characters</H2>
Choose the character you want to select.
If you decided, click on that character.
Now you will see the selected character appear in the top edit box.

<A NAME="3"><H2>3. Select more characters</H2>
Repeat the above step until you think you're finished.

<A NAME="4"><H2>4. Copy or cut to clipboard</H2>
Click now on the "Copy" or "Cut" button, depending on what you want to do.
You can also use the menu or toolbar instead of the button.

<A NAME="5"><H2>5. Paste from clipboard</H2>
Switch to your text editor, word processor, whatever.
Now press the middle mouse button (or emulate it by press both left and right mouse button).
The text is now pasted!

<A NAME="6"><H2>Why doesn't the text get pasted?</H2>
If you try to paste the text from clipboard but it doesn not appear, then there are two resons why:

<UL>
<LI>You closed Gnome Character Map after you copied the text to clipboard.
X is not like Microsoft Windows; if you shut down an application, any data written to the clipboard by that application is lost.
The golden rule: paste the text first, then shut down Gnome Character Map.</LI>
<LI>You click at the wrong place in your editor/whatever! You shut click at the text-editing area.</LI>
</UL>
