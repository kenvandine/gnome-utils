Readme for Gnome Character Map
------------------------------
The Gnome Character Map is Microsoft Windowss' Character Map's
equalivant for Unix/X11/Gnome. I wrote this program because, as
far as I know, there isn't any Character Map-like written yet.

The current version number can be found in the file VERSION.
It also give you information about the current version.

This program is, of course, free software. I think all software
in Linux should be free (as in freedom) or Open Source.
Down with propritary software! HA HA HA HA HA!!!
