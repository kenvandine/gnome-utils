	* card.c: (card_geopos_str, card_timezn_str, card_bday_str) new 
		functions to help representing the information in the 
		interfase.
	* gnomecard.c: a couple of bug fixes (sigsegvs and functionality).
		I'm using gnome_canvas for the wysywyg view.
		Almost all the data of the card is represented in the
		tree now.
		New 'First' and 'Last' buttons.
		The tree view now uses solid lines and the scrollbars
		appear only if necessary. It also freezes while adding
		cards when loading.
	* addrtool.xpm: for future use.
	* last.xpm, next.xpm: the pixmaps for the corresponding buttons.
		Should these go with the stock?
	* org.xpm, exp.xpm: for the corresponding sections in the tree.

		       Several other GUI functionalities and routines to
		       make my life easier in future development with 
		       gnomecard.
