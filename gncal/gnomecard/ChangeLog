1998-11-30 Michael Fulbright <drmike@redhat.com>

	* gnomecard.c: changed so user can arbitrarily resize main app window
	* list.c: correctly handle selection changes in clist for master
	card list via kbd input

1998-11-29 Michael Fulbright <drmike@redhat.com>

	* canvas.c: completely initial attempt at having a complete
	card view presented via a canvas to the right side of the
	master card listing.

1998-11-29 Michael Fulbright <drmike@redhat.com>

	* changed sorting functions to use ColumnType as argument for
	column you want to sort by, not the actually sorting function.
	There are helper functions to map between ColumnType and sorting
	function.

	* started to rework the canvas display of the currently selected
	card. Still in early stages.

	* Column display editor is pretty complete, will store
	user configuration persistantly via gnome_config.

Sat Nov 28 22:58:10 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnomecard.c: remove right justify stuff

1998-11-26 Michael Fulbright <drmike@redhat.com>

	* many files: Column Header Editor almost working, so you can
	pick which columns are displayed in the master column list.

1998-11-19  Jonathan Blandford  <jrb@redhat.com>

	* gnomecard.c (main): CORBA added...

1998-11-14 Michael Fulbright <drmike@redhat.com>
        * dialog.c, gnomecard.c, list.[ch], sort.c: changed
	gnomecard_rebuild_list() to not require user to pass
	currently selected card as an argument. Instead we just
	look in clist structure to determine currently selected
	card, and restore selection to this card after we rebuild
	list.

	Also moved majority of code which modifies the card list display
	into list.c. Next step is to made rest of code independent of
	the current global variable gnomecard_list.

1998-11-14 Michael Fulbright <drmike@redhat.com>
        * gnomecard.c, list.[ch]: added functions to create column
	titles and values based on user configuration of the
	columns they want shown in the master card list.

	Also added code to handle sorting by column when user clicks
	column title button at top of clist
	
1998-11-13 Michael Fulbright <drmike@redhat.com>
	* columnhdrs.[ch]: moved code to allow customization of
	column headers in main card view into these files.

	* other files: modified to use the new columnhdrs functions
	for building card list. Not complete yet...
	
1998-11-12  Michael Fulbright <drmike@redhat.com>
	* gnomecard.c: removed hpaned for now, had very funky behavior...
	
1998-11-11  Michael Fulbright <drmike@redhat.com>
        * gnomecard.c: fixed gnomecard_list to work with recent clist changes

	* phonelist.[ch]: moved code to handle phone list part fo
	card edit property box into a separate file. 

	* addresslist.[ch]: moved code to handle address list part fo
	card edit property box into a separate file. 

1998-11-11  Michael Fulbright <drmike@redhat.com>
	* dialog.c: beginings of phone number support

	The way the phone number and address types are handled will be
	changed soon - the current radio button to control the type is
	a kludge.

1998-11-11  Michael Fulbright <drmike@redhat.com>
	* sort.c: fixed sorting so it works again

	* dialog.c: changed gnomecard_prop_close to accept ptr to Card
	struct being editted argument instead of ptr to the GList element
	containing the card. This is because the order of cards in the
	gnomecard_crds GList can change after the user edits data and sorting
	criteria is applied, and the ptr to the GList element containing
	the card is not necessarily invariant.  Better to just pass a
	ptr to the Card itself anyways.
	
1998-11-10  Michael Fulbright <drmike@redhat.com>
        * list.c: Changed mechanism for determining relationship between
	a row in the gnomcard_list clist and the matching Card struct.
	We assign as row data for each row a ptr to the  Card struct.

	* gnomecard.c, dialog.c, del.c: Fixed so we can delete entries now.
	Replaced most of the code in del.c with a single function
	gnomecard_delete_current_card.

	* card.c: fixed card_free() to remove address structures properly
	
1998-11-10  Michael Fulbright <drmike@redhat.com>
	* card.[ch], pairs.h, cardtypes.h: Changed PROP_DELADDR to 
	PROP_POSTADDR

1998-11-10  Michael Fulbright <drmike@redhat.com>
        * card.[ch]: Changed how the postal address type is handled.
	Changed the name of several things to not include 'deladdr' in
	their name, which I found confusing. These are now 'postaddr'
	instead.
	
	* dialog.c:  I've made the addresses for a person a part of
	the main card editting property box.  Currently there more address
	types than I think are required. I want to eventually move to
	a system where the user can add an arbitrary number of address
	types beyond the default allowed.

	* gnomecard.c: I've made the dbl-click and right button click
	menus for an item insensitive if the item is already being
	editted.

1998-11-07  Michael Fulbright <drmike@redhat.com>
	* (many files):

	- have removed most of tree view code since now using list view
	  some routines remain (commented out) until I replace them
	  with list equivalents

	- noticed in card.c a nasty str_val() macro that depends upon
	  the a local variable being present! Will have to go through
	  and change all that (its in alot of places) because that
	  is just asking for a problem.

	
1998-11-04  Michael Fulbright <msf@redhat.com>
	* (many files): I wanted to summarize what I've been doing the
	past week:

	- moved to a list view instead of the tree view because it
	  seems most people feel this is the right way to go

	- moved address/phone/email dialogs into the main card edit
	  dialog.  I think it is best to have as much information
	  visible as possible so users can quickly find the information
	  they need.

	This has involved touching alot of the source code, but  
	I am reusing a great deal of the original code.

1998-10-25  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* del.c: Now you can delete the whole list of email addresses of a
	contact, his name, his birthday and a whole bunch of those. This
	needs refining.

1998-10-23  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* card.c: Modified structures to allow identification of every card
	property through piggybacking. Modifications all over the code to
	adapt to this.
	* del.c: Now you can delete individual e-mail entries. Eventualy, it
	should be possible to delete any item in any card.

1998-10-15  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnomecard.c: (sortmenu) Changed GNOME_APP_UI_RADIOITEMS for
	GNOME_APP_UI_ITEM. This fixes the sort menu not showing.
		(helpmenu) Eliminated invalid entry.
	* dialog.c: Various gnomecard_append_file bug fixes. It should work
	right now.

1998-10-14  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* dialog.c: (gnomecard_edit) Fixed timezone marked as "used"
	when editting a card.

1998-09-26  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	The code of GnomeCard gets split (finally)!
        * Makefile.am: included all the new files.

1998-09-25  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnomecard.c: (gnomecard_sort_by_fname, gnomecard_init): the column
	button just toggles the radio_menu_item of "sort by fname" to TRUE so 
	that the callback for that radio_menu_item executes the sorting.
	
1998-09-25  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnomecard.c: broke gnomecard_sort_cards into several functions.
	(gnomecard_open_file): now sorts the file when loading.
	(gnomecard_update_tree): now the card is relocated to its sorted 
		position.
	(gnomecard_cmp_names): new sorting function.	
	(gnomecard_cmp_emails): new sorting function.

1998-09-22  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* Makefile.am (gnomecard_SOURCES): Added missing cardtypes.h.

1998-09-17  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnomecard.c: (gnomecard_cards_blocked): It only checked for the
	curr_crd. fixed.

1998-08-13  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnomecard.c: (gnomecard_sort_cards): Sorting. Click on the left button
	of the ctree and the cards will be ordered by fname. Ordering by other
	fields shall come soon.

1998-08-12  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnomecard.c: Save and load with gnome_config the last opened file and
	open it at startup. Bug fixes.

1998-08-09  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnomecard.c: (gnomecard_find_card): oh, yes: the find utility is here.
		I'm using shell wilcard pattern matching (fnmatch) instead of regexps.
		BTW: any resemblance with Netscape's find utility is pure coincidence.

1998-08-08  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* card.[hc], gnomecard.c: CardDelAddr now uses an array of DELADDR_MAX
		char pointers, instead of using named structure members. It was
		getting pretty heary... how could one arrive to these situations?
		Where did common sense go?
	* cardfind.xpm, Makefile.am: new icon for find utility!
	* gnomecard.c (gnomecard_find_card_call): getting ready for the find 
		utility	(to regexp or not to regexp?)

1998-08-07  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnomecard.c: (gnomecard_init_defaults, gnomecard_setup_apply): 
		added gnome_config routines.
												        
1998-08-07  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnomecard.c: (gnomecard_set_node_info): Avoids repeating code and
		allows updating the tree according to the property changes.
		(gnomecard_setup_apply): Now the tree is updated.

1998-08-07  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnomecard.c: (gnomecard_add_card_sections_to_tree): If there is
		only one item, phone, e-mail and delivery addresses sections now 
		show directly its	single item.
		(gnomecard_setup): Now you can choose to see the e-mail and/or
		the phone at the side of each card's root.

1998-08-06  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* card.c: fixed multi-line comment saving bug.
	* gnomecard.c: (gnomecard_add_dellabel): getting ready for
		handling delivery labels.

1998-08-06  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnomecard.c (gnomecard_update_tree): node should initially point to
		the children of the crd->user_data.
		(main): Now using a hpaned for the app_contents (much nicer).
		(gnomecard_add_card_sections_to_tree): Phone numbers now show
			their properties in the same node as the number.
		(gnomecard_update_tree): e-mail address shown with the
			formatted name of each card.

1998-08-03  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* Made the code use GtkCTreeNode instead of GList, for the new ctree.

	* gnomecard.c (gnomecard_update_tree): Use GTK_CTREE_NODE_NEXT,
	since the nodes are opaque structures now.

1998-08-03  Arturo Espinods Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnomecard.c: gnome_canvas_new now needs no arguments. Corrected.

1998-07-31  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnomecard.c: Several GUI fixes and refinements.
	* card.c:      Fixed address save bug: should have used
		VCCityProp instead of VCLocationProp. Changed field name of 
		locality in CardDelAddr to city.

1998-07-25  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnomecard.c: You can add delivery addresses now.

1998-07-24  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnomecard.c: (viewmenu, gnomecard_toggle_.*_view) New menu for hiding
	and showing the canvas and the tree.
	FIXME: I can't figure out how ti make gtk+ recalculate the vbox's size.

1998-07-23  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnomecard.c: You can add phone numbers now.

1998-07-22  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

  * gnomecard.c: several bug fixes. Check the workaround at
  gnomecard_update_tree.
	(gnomecard_add_email, gnomecard_email_call,
	 gnomecard_add_card_sections_to_tree) - You can add emails now (finally).

1998-07-19  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

  * gnomecard.c: (gnomecard_spawn_new) Now you can spawn another gnomecard
	from gnomecard. This will be useful as soon as I implement DND. gnomecard
  must be in your path.

1998-07-17  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnomecard.c: (gnomecard_update_canvas) I'll add all the wysiwyg
	displaying functionality here. The card view now updates when
	the card is being editted and "Apply" is clicked.
		(gnomecard_destroy_cards) now checks for any blocked cards
		and shows an error if there are any, then returns FALSE.
		(gnomecard_cards_blocked) added.

1998-07-16  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* card.c: (card_geopos_str, card_timezn_str, card_bday_str) new 
		functions to help representing the information in the 
		interfase.
	* gnomecard.c: a couple of bug fixes (sigsegvs and functionality).
		I'm using gnome_canvas for the wysywyg view.
		Almost all the data of the card is represented in the
		tree now.
		New 'First' and 'Last' buttons.
		The tree view now uses solid lines and the scrollbars
		appear only if necessary. It also freezes while adding
		cards when loading.
	* addrtool.xpm: for future use.
	* last.xpm, next.xpm: the pixmaps for the corresponding buttons.
		Should these go with the stock?
	* org.xpm, exp.xpm: for the corresponding sections in the tree.

Thu Jul 16 18:59:34 EDT 1998 Manish Vachharajani <mvachhar@vger.rutgers.edu>

	* gnomecard.c: make it use the most recent ctree interface
	
1998-06-16  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnomecard.c: new funcionality: "Take from Name" button in
	gnomecard_edit.

1998-06-13  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* card.h, card.c: added a flag in the Card structure to handle
	                  per-card blocking.

	* gnomecard.h: new GnomeCardSib struct to hold tree's sections for 
	               each card's user_data.
	* gnomecard.c: delete and edit now block, thanks to the new flag.
	               gnomecard_add_card_to_tree created.
	               Prev & Next now scroll the tree.
		       Several other GUI functionalities and routines to
		       make my life easier in future development with 
		       gnomecard.
	
	* various xpms for the tree icons added to the cvs. The tree view
	  starts getting shape.

1998-06-10  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnomecard.c: Started with the tree view.
	* card.h:      Added void* at the end for flexibility.
