	* gnomecard.c: (gnomecard_find_card): oh, yes: the find utility is here.
		I'm using shell wilcard pattern matching (fnmatch) instead of regexps.
		BTW: any resemblance with Netscape's find utility is pure coincidence.

1998-08-08  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* card.[hc], gnomecard.c: CardDelAddr now uses an array of DELADDR_MAX
		char pointers, instead of using named structure members. It was
		getting pretty heary... how could one arrive to these situations?
		Where did common sense go?
	* cardfind.xpm, Makefile.am: new icon for find utility!
	* gnomecard.c (gnomecard_find_card_call): getting ready for the find 
		utility	(to regexp or not to regexp?)

1998-08-07  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnomecard.c: (gnomecard_init_defaults, gnomecard_setup_apply): 
		added gnome_config routines.
												        
1998-08-07  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnomecard.c: (gnomecard_set_node_info): Avoids repeating code and
		allows updating the tree according to the property changes.
		(gnomecard_setup_apply): Now the tree is updated.

1998-08-07  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnomecard.c: (gnomecard_add_card_sections_to_tree): If there is
		only one item, phone, e-mail and delivery addresses sections now 
		show directly its	single item.
		(gnomecard_setup): Now you can choose to see the e-mail and/or
		the phone at the side of each card's root.

1998-08-06  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* card.c: fixed multi-line comment saving bug.
	* gnomecard.c: (gnomecard_add_dellabel): getting ready for
		handling delivery labels.

1998-08-06  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnomecard.c (gnomecard_update_tree): node should initially point to
		the children of the crd->user_data.
		(main): Now using a hpaned for the app_contents (much nicer).
		(gnomecard_add_card_sections_to_tree): Phone numbers now show
			their properties in the same node as the number.
		(gnomecard_update_tree): e-mail address shown with the
			formatted name of each card.

1998-08-03  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* Made the code use GtkCTreeNode instead of GList, for the new ctree.

	* gnomecard.c (gnomecard_update_tree): Use GTK_CTREE_NODE_NEXT,
	since the nodes are opaque structures now.

1998-08-03  Arturo Espinods Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnomecard.c: gnome_canvas_new now needs no arguments. Corrected.

1998-07-31  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnomecard.c: Several GUI fixes and refinements.
	* card.c:      Fixed address save bug: should have used
		VCCityProp instead of VCLocationProp. Changed field name of 
		locality in CardDelAddr to city.

1998-07-25  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnomecard.c: You can add delivery addresses now.

1998-07-24  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnomecard.c: (viewmenu, gnomecard_toggle_.*_view) New menu for hiding
	and showing the canvas and the tree.
	FIXME: I can't figure out how ti make gtk+ recalculate the vbox's size.

1998-07-23  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnomecard.c: You can add phone numbers now.

1998-07-22  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

  * gnomecard.c: several bug fixes. Check the workaround at
  gnomecard_update_tree.
	(gnomecard_add_email, gnomecard_email_call,
	 gnomecard_add_card_sections_to_tree) - You can add emails now (finally).

1998-07-19  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

  * gnomecard.c: (gnomecard_spawn_new) Now you can spawn another gnomecard
	from gnomecard. This will be useful as soon as I implement DND. gnomecard
  must be in your path.

1998-07-17  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnomecard.c: (gnomecard_update_canvas) I'll add all the wysiwyg
	displaying functionality here. The card view now updates when
	the card is being editted and "Apply" is clicked.
		(gnomecard_destroy_cards) now checks for any blocked cards
		and shows an error if there are any, then returns FALSE.
		(gnomecard_cards_blocked) added.

1998-07-16  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* card.c: (card_geopos_str, card_timezn_str, card_bday_str) new 
		functions to help representing the information in the 
		interfase.
	* gnomecard.c: a couple of bug fixes (sigsegvs and functionality).
		I'm using gnome_canvas for the wysywyg view.
		Almost all the data of the card is represented in the
		tree now.
		New 'First' and 'Last' buttons.
		The tree view now uses solid lines and the scrollbars
		appear only if necessary. It also freezes while adding
		cards when loading.
	* addrtool.xpm: for future use.
	* last.xpm, next.xpm: the pixmaps for the corresponding buttons.
		Should these go with the stock?
	* org.xpm, exp.xpm: for the corresponding sections in the tree.

	                  per-card blocking.

	* gnomecard.h: new GnomeCardSib struct to hold tree's sections for 
	               each card's user_data.

	               gnomecard_add_card_to_tree created.
	               Prev & Next now scroll the tree.
		       Several other GUI functionalities and routines to
		       make my life easier in future development with 
		       gnomecard.
	
	* various xpms for the tree icons added to the cvs. The tree view
	  starts getting shape.

1998-06-10  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnomecard.c: Started with the tree view.
	* card.h:      Added void* at the end for flexibility.
