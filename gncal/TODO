Gnome date selection widget:

- Make the calendar a `real' popup window like in GtkCombo.

- Make the displayed date be localized properly -- use strftime().

Event editor dialog:

- Resize the window and fix whatever is resized in an ugly fashion.

Full day view widget:

- Layout the children nicely like M$ Schedule or Netscape Calendar do
  (i.e. make them not overlap each other).

Month view:

- Write a month view widget.

Week view:

- Replace the calendar by a `task density' widget like in Solaris cm.

Day view:

- Add a calendar and a to-do list widget.

General:

- Ask the user whether to save the calendar when he quits the program.

- Write online help.  Nice help.  Lots of help.
