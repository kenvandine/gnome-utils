Gnome date selection widget:

- Make the displayed date be localized properly -- use strftime().

Full day widget:

- Display alarm/whatever flags somewhere.

- Layout the children nicely like M$ Schedule or Netscape Calendar do
  (i.e. make them not overlap each other).

Month view:

- Write a month view widget.

Week view:

- Replace the calendar by a `task density' widget like in Solaris cm.

Day view:

- Highlight the days with appointments in the calendar.

General:

- See that the views synchronize when you do a gnome_calendar_goto().

- Write online help.  Nice help.  Lots of help.
