Month view:

- Display little boxes for the appointments of each day.

- Double click on a day takes you to the day view.

- DnD of appointments to move them around.

Year view:

- Make it use GnomeMonthItem to make it have a reasonable size.

Week view:

- Nice display as in the Palm Pilot.

Day view:

- Rewrite in terms of the canvas and make it pretty.

Preferences:

- BUG: 12/24 hours stuff is not consistent - I remember that on editing
  new appointment you get the time-selectors always on 12-hr format

Event editor dialog:

- Make it figure out whether the alarm is in
  minutes/hours/days/etc. (via a cascade of conditions) and set the
  widgets appropriately.

Gnome date selection widget:

- Make the displayed date be localized properly -- use strftime().

General:

- Write online help.  Nice help.  Lots of help.
