BUGS:

- Goto dialog: fix recoloring of marked days when a LeaveNotify event
  is gotten for an item.

- Recurrence end date is wrong.  An event that repeats daily will not
  be included in the ending date of the recurrence (off-by-one error?).

Month view:

- Display little boxes for the appointments of each day.

- Double click on a day takes you to the day view.

- DnD of appointments to move them around.

Year view:

- Use a generic mark_month() function to mark a GnomeMonthItem with
  all the events that touch it.  Pass a function to mark_month() that
  actually does the marking (the year view and goto dialog just change
  the color of the days with events; the month view does more
  sophisticated layout).

- Double click on a day takes you to the day view.

- Button-3 popup with options:
	Create new appointment in this day
	--- separator ---
	Go to this day
	Go to this week
	Go to this month

- See why it is so fucking slow.

Week view:

- Nice display as in the Palm Pilot.

Day view:

- Rewrite in terms of the canvas and make it pretty.

Preferences:

- BUG: 12/24 hours stuff is not consistent - I remember that on editing
  new appointment you get the time-selectors always on 12-hr format

Event editor dialog:

- Make it figure out whether the alarm is in
  minutes/hours/days/etc. (via a cascade of conditions) and set the
  widgets appropriately.

Gnome date selection widget:

- Make the displayed date be localized properly -- use strftime().

General:

- Write online help.  Nice help.  Lots of help.
