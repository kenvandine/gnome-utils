BUGS:

- Recurrence end date is wrong.  An event that repeats daily will not
  be included in the ending date of the recurrence (off-by-one error?).

General:

- Color properties, highlight some days and such.

- Mark the current day in BOLD as well as different color (color blind users will need it).

- Write online help.  Nice help.  Lots of help.

Year view:

- Prelight days on mouse enter/leave.  Share that code with goto.c.

- Double click on a day takes you to the day view.

- Button-3 popup with options:
	Create new appointment in this day
	--- separator ---
	Go to this day
	Go to this week
	Go to this month

- See why it is so fucking slow.

Month view:

- Display little boxes for the appointments of each day.

- Double click on a day takes you to the day view.

- DnD of appointments to move them around.

Week view:

- Nice display as in the Palm Pilot.

Day view:

- Rewrite in terms of the canvas and make it pretty.

Preferences:

- BUG: 12/24 hours stuff is not consistent - I remember that on editing
  new appointment you get the time-selectors always on 12-hr format

Event editor dialog:

- Make it figure out whether the alarm is in
  minutes/hours/days/etc. (via a cascade of conditions) and set the
  widgets appropriately.

Gnome date selection widget:

- Make the displayed date be localized properly -- use strftime().
