BUGS:

- Recurrence end date is wrong.  An event that repeats daily will not
  be included in the ending date of the recurrence (off-by-one error?).

Year view:

- See why it is so fucking slow when opening its notebook page for the
  first time.

Month view:

- Display little boxes for the appointments of each day.

- Popup menu like in the year view.

- Double click on a day takes you to the day view.

- DnD of appointments to move them around.

Week view:

- Nice display as in the Palm Pilot.

Day view:

- Rewrite in terms of the canvas and make it pretty.

Preferences:

- BUG: 12/24 hours stuff is not consistent - I remember that on editing
  new appointment you get the time-selectors always on 12-hr format

Event editor dialog:

- Make it figure out whether the alarm is in
  minutes/hours/days/etc. (via a cascade of conditions) and set the
  widgets appropriately.

Gnome date selection widget:

- Make the displayed date be localized properly -- use strftime().

General:

- Write online help.  Nice help.  Lots of help.

- If you leave the calendar running overnight, the "current day"
  marker in the GnomeMonthItems does not get updated.
