1998-04-13  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* eventedit.c (event_editor_setup_time_frame): Re-aligned some
	widgets to make it look prettier.
	(ee_alarm_widgets): Likewise.
	(ee_init_general_page): Likewise.
	(ee_classification_widgets): Likewise.
	(event_editor_init_widgets): Likewise.

	* gnome-cal.c (day_view_range_activated): Create new object and
	add it to the calendar.  You can now select a range in the
	full-day view, hit Return, and a new event will be added at the
	selected range.  I still have to figure out how to focus this new child.

	* gncal-full-day.c (paint_back): Rewrote function to avoid
	painting an area more than once -- eliminate flicker.
	(paint_back_rows): New function that calls paint_back() only for
	the area of the specified rows.
	(gncal_full_day_button_press): 
	(gncal_full_day_button_release): 
	(gncal_full_day_motion): Made these functions use
	paint_back_rows() instead of paint_back(), to eliminate flicker.  Wheee!

1998-04-12  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnome-cal.c (setup_day_view): We now connect to the
	range_activated signal of the fullday widget instead of catching
	key presses ourselves.
	(day_view_range_activated): New function that creates a new
	iCalObject and inserts it into the calendar, not finished yet.

1998-04-11  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gncal-full-day.c (get_time_from_rows): New function, calculates
	a pair of time_t values from the specified start and number of rows.

	* gncal-full-day.h (GncalFullDayClass): New signal
	"range_activated".  It is emitted when a range is selected and the
	user hits Return.
	(gncal_full_day_selection_range): New function, returns the
	selected range.

	* gncal-full-day.c (struct drag_info): Moved selection information
	to their own fields instead of sharing the child's drag fields.
	This allows us to keep the selection when a child is moved.
	(recompute_motion): Made the case when (row < di->sel_click_row)
	work correctly.

1998-04-11  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnome-cal.c (gnome_calendar_goto): Add support for navigating
	on the day view.

	* timeutil.c (time_start_of_day, time_end_of_day, time_day_hour):
	New time manipulation functions. 

	* eventedit.c (ee_rp_init_frequency): Add the different frequency
	editors to a notebook.  Make the notebook startup on the entry
	selected recurrence type;

1998-04-11  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gncal-full-day.c (recompute_motion): Now we support selecting a
	range in the main window (by clicking+dragging).  It flickers
	horribly and is not perfect, but it is a start.

1998-04-09  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gncal-full-day.c: #include <string.h>

	* gncal-full-day.c (child_map): Show instead of just map the child
	widget (otherwise the text widget gets confused and will not focus).

	* calobj.c (ical_object_to_vobject): Quote chars as 'x', not "x".

	* calobj.h: Added prototype for ical_object_to_vobject().

	* gnome-cal.c (gnome_calendar_object_changed): New function.  This
	should be called when a calendar object is changed.

	* gncal-full-day.c (update_from_drag_info): Call
	gnome_calendar_object_changed() instead of updating manually.

	* calendar.c (calendar_add_object):
	(calendar_remove_object): Set the modified flag to true.

	* gncal-full-day.c (gncal_full_day_draw): Finished implementing
	this function.

1998-04-08  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* gncal.c (update_calendar): Say `#if 0', not `#ifdef 0'.

1998-04-07  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* eventedit.c: Removed unused global variable parent_class.

	* eventedit.h: Renamed gtk_window field to window.
	Made the parent_class field in the EventEditorClass structure be a
	GtkWindowClass, not a gnome property box class.

1998-04-06  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gncal-week-view.c (gncal_week_view_new): Use the new
	gtk_table_set_homogeneous() instead of setting the variable directly.

1998-04-03  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* eventedit.c (ee_create_ae): Make it return void.
	(ee_alarm_widgets): Remove some unused variables.
	(ee_store_alarm): Make it return void.
	#include <string.h>

	* eventedit.h: #include "gnome-cal.h"

	* calobj.c (list_free): Don't use g_free in the g_list_foreach.

	* calendar.h: Add prototype for calendar_load().

	* timeutil.h: Add prototypes for time_add_*().

	* calendar.c:
	* calobj.c:
	* eventedit.c:
	* gnome-cal.c: #include "timeutil.h"

	* gncal-day-view.c (gncal_day_view_size_request): Make the minimum
	width equal or larger to the title width.

	(main): Add a return statement.
	(new_calendar): Show stuff *after* the calendar has been loaded.

	* gnome-cal.c (gnome_calendar_load): Update the day view.
	(setup_widgets): Hackish setup of a day view widget - will fix later.
	(gnome_calendar_init): Initialize all fields.

	* gnome-cal.h: Added day_view field.  Maybe this should be changed
	when the a complete day view panel is complete.

	* gncal-day-view.c (gncal_day_view_update): Draw after update, not
	before.

1998-04-06  Carsten Schaar  <nhadcasc@fs-maphy.uni-hannover.de>

	* timeutil.c (time_add_year, time_add_year, time_add_week):
	Routines for time manipulation.

	* calobj.c (ical_object_destroy): Full destruction of the object.

	* eventedit.c: Finished the main event editor form;  It still
	lacks the details and the recurrence bits.  It now adds events
	and cancels. 

1998-04-03  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* view-utils.c (view_utils_draw_events): The "better" format
	string for strftime() wasn't better, after all :-(

1998-04-02  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gncal-full-day.c: New full-day widget.  It is still a work in
	progress.  It will be similar to M$ Schedule's nifty full day view
	widget, but with Gtk's elegance :-)

	* Makefile.am (gnomecal_SOURCES): Added gncal-full-day.[ch] to the sources.

1998-04-02  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	specifier for strftime().
	(view_utils_draw_textured_frame): Ultra-nifty function to draw
	textured "metal" frames, like Netscape's handles.

1998-04-02  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gncal-day-view.c (gncal_day_view_update): Day events are now
	cached inside the widget.  They get initialized at this time.

	* view-utils.c (view_utils_draw_events): Use the list of events. 

1998-04-02  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gncal-day-view.c (gncal_day_view_set_shadow): New customization
	function.  We can't decide on a stupid border type :-)
	(gncal_day_view_init): Made GTK_SHADOW_ETCHED_IN be the default
	shadow type.  Looks good.

1998-04-02  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* main.c: New main program that uses our new datatypes and
	objects. 

	* calendar.c (calendar_load_from_vobject, calendar_load):
	Implement loading of vCalendar objects and vCalendar files. 

	* calobj.c (ical_object_create_from_vobject): Implement loading of
	vCalendar event and todo objects. 

	* timeutil.c (isodate_from_time_t): New function. 

	* gnome-cal.c, gnome-cal.h: Implement a toplevel widget, derived
	from GnomeApp.  It holds all of the day views and arbitrates the
	display.

1998-04-02  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gncal-week-view.[ch]: New week view composite widget.  This
	provides a full week view (7 day views plus busy time display --
	the latter is currently unimplemented).

1998-04-01  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gncal-day-view.c: New day view widget.  It is intended to be a
	child widget of the week view composite widget.

	* calendar.c (calendar_get_objects_in_range):
	(calendar_get_events_in_range): 
	(calendar_get_journal_in_range): 
	(calendar_get_journal_in_range): These functions now take a
	sort_func parameter, which is of type GCompareFunc.  If the
	specified value is non-NULL, it will return a sorted list.
	Otherwise, it will return an unordered list.
	(calendar_compare_by_dtstart): Provide a generic sorting routine
	for calendar objects.

Tue Mar 31 23:46:50 1998  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

1998-03-31  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	from libgnomeui.

	* Makefile.am (gncal_SOURCES): Added new source files to the rules.

	* timeutil.c (format_simple_hour): New function, formats an
	hour/am_pm pair into a string of the form "3am", "12pm", "05h",
	"19h", etc.  It is used by the day view widget for its labels.

1998-03-31 Craig Small <csmall@small.dropbear.id.au>

	* Now has (non working) session maangement
	* Uses a clist for the dailylist like gtt

Sat Mar 21 15:43:20 1998  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

	* gncal.c: Use gnome_message_box_*, not gnome_messagebox_*.

1998-03-12  Craig Small <csmall@small.dropbear.id.au>

	* Now linked (in some horrible way) to the gtkcalendar widget.
