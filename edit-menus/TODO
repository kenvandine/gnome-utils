Known problems:

If you try to cut the root menu, the program will get horribly
confused.

When the test menu is being created, Gtk dribbles little gray squares.

The icewm-saver doesn't handle memory right, and it doesn't write
to disk.

No i18n, no gnome-config, no standard accelerators, etc.

Menu icons aren't shown in the tree view.

Need a way to handle "special" cases: e.g. the root menu, special
window manager commands (restart, etc.), multiple save files (e.g.
system and user, or the Debian menu system), inability to save to
system files.

The tree view should be a widget, that manages the selection and so
on. This would allow 2 tree views, and reduce the number of global
variables. This is already started in the menutree.* files - if you
work on this please don't feel bound by the cruddy API in menutree.h
now, figure out a good one.
